<p class=first>
	Time for a new project and a new toy. This toy is a fidget toy consisting of eight 
	cubes connected via hinges. The idea and plan come from 
	<a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/brass_infinity_cube">Mitxela.com</a>. The 
	author has a great website including a forum, where I was able to post a question 
	about the CAD drawing. The author answered within 24 hours!
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC CAD.png" alt="The CAD drawing from the web." width="574" height="364">

<p>
	The first step is preparing the cubes: rough cutting from stock, milling to size, 
	and chamfering all edges. A 12" length of brass 3/4" square stock was purchased. 
	Eight lengths were cut from this bar stock slightly longer than 3/4" using the 
	bandsaw.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC rough cut.heic" alt="Eight rough cut cubes." width="2495" height="1967">


<p>
	Each of these proto-cubes were held on parallels in the mill vise. One of the sawn 
	sides was milled flat with the two insert end mill. These half-milled cubes were 
	paired up by length, held on parallels and milled to 0.750". The three photos 
	document the process
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC eight cubes.heic" alt="Eight cubes." width="1428" height="1657">

<p>
	A jig for the mitered edges was recommended, so that was the next order of business. 
	A block of aluminum was located that is 3/4" thick. A number of attempts were made 
	to hold the block on the angle plate. One was finally found to be functional. It is 
	seen in the photo below. Quite the risky setup! The end mill was aligned at what 
	would become the top of the 45&deg; groove. It was lowered 0.010" for each pass initially. 
	About halfway through this was decreased to 0.0075" per pass. With a slow speed of 
	rotation there was not much chatter. It took many passes to get to 0.35" deep. 
	The block with the completed groove cut is shown in the second photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC groove milled.heic" alt="The aluminum block after milling the angled groove." width="1610" height="1734">

<p>
	The next step was creating the opening for the end mill. The end of the jig was 
	marked out such that a 3/8" hole would be close to the bottom of the V-groove. The 
	punched mark was center drilled, drilled with a 1/4" drill and then a 5/16" drill. 
	The hole was opened to 3/8" with a four flute end mill. The back side of the hole 
	was opened with the end mill in 0.020" passes and went smoothly. The end mill was 
	aligned with the front of the hole and moved forward 0.020". It was lowered to the 
	bottom of the hole. A couple of repetitions and a tiny hole was opened in the bottom 
	of the V-groove. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC jig complete.heic" alt="The chamfering jig completed with a passage for the end mill." width="1337" height="1541">

<p>
	The cubes were pushed by the end mill by hand. This was extremely difficult as there 
	was tremendous chatter at a couple of different speeds. The resulting chamfers are 
	some of the worst I have seen. Admittedly, it was a quick operation to chamfer all 
	96 edges.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC cubes chamfered.heic" alt="The eight cubes with all edges chamfered." width="1415" height="1537">

<p>
	The cubes were all marked for hinge locations. Two sets of four were made with the 
	set members being mirror images of the opposite set. This is more easily seen in the 
	photo below than described.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC hinge locations.heic" alt="The hinge locations marked on all eight cubes." width="1807" height="1546">

<p>
	Hinges are next on the to-do list. Based on a few measurements taken from the CAD 
	drawing on the Mitxela website a rough guess at relevant dimensions for the hinges 
	is as follows: distance between pins is 3/16", length of the linkages is 3/8", 
	thickness of the linkages is 1/16", and linkage width is 1/8". There is essentially 
	no gap between cubes when the linkage is closed. The hinge cutouts look to be 1/8" 
	deep and 1/32" beyond the linkage. The hinge cutouts in the cube corners need to be 
	1/8" deep and 3/16" in each direction. (Really only 7/32" in one direction, along the 
	linkage axis, but easier to keep both dimensions identical.) A #51 drill (0.067") 
	will be used for the hinge pin holes. 3/4" hinge pins will provide the needed 1/16" 
	at each end for peening.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The edges marked out with the Sharpie above need a larger chamfer to permit easier 
	hinge movement. For clarity sake the cutouts for the hinges are on the ends of these 
	edges.
</p>

<p>
	Increasing the chamfer on two marked edges per cube was the first order of business this 
	morning. This was not done with the jig described above, but by holding two cubes 
	on parallels in the mill vise and using a chamfering end mill. This worked so well 
	that the rest of the edges were chamfered again. (At least the edges that were not 
	already chamfered too deeply to clean up.) The two photos below show the larger 
	chamfers and the cubes after chamfering all edges. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC all chamfers.heic" alt="All edges of the cubes chamfered again." width="1599" height="1858">

<p>
	Milling the hinge pockets was done with the mill vise using a machinist's clamp as a 
	stop. The corner was located with the edge finder. A 3/16" end mill was set 3/16" 
	into the cube on the y-axis. The end mill was advanced on the x-axis 0.188" in 0.010" 
	increments. The end mill was advanced on the y-axis out of the pocket as the last 
	cutting operation. The photo below shows the result of the first pocket milling 
	operation.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC pocket.heic" alt="The first pocket cut with an end mill." width="1769" height="1715">

<p>
	The second and adjacent pocket was milled next and took about seven minutes including 
	setup. The pockets need to be deburred prior to milling the second pocket of the 
	pair. Four cubes, sixteen pockets were milled before taking a break. The remainder 
	were finished the next day. There were two mistakes on one hinge location, where I 
	screwed up the direction of milling, the spindle axis needs to align with the eventual 
	pin axis. These mistakes were repaired as much as possible. Hopefully the hinge will 
	hide most of the damage, or else the cube will need to be remade. The photo below 
	shows the eight cubes with four hinge pockets milled in each. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC hinge pockets.heic" alt="Four hinge pockets milled in each of the eight cubes." width="1715" height="1685">

<p>
	The setup for drilling the cubes was similar to that for milling the pockets. The 
	cube was pressed against a clamp stop in the mill vise. The corner to be drilled 
	was located adjacent to the clamp and the back of the vise. The edges were located 
	and the spindle moved 3/32" in from each edge. Each hole was started with a center 
	drill and continued through with a #51 drill, 0.067". After the first 0.150 - 0.200" 
	the drill was pulled from the hole and cleaned of chips every 0.050". The burrs on 
	the hole exit were removed with the center drill. A drilled cube is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC drilled.heic" alt="A cube showing the two drilled holes for the hinge pins." width="1316" height="1111">

<p class="note">
	When drilling the first hole looking at the drill as it was about half-way through, 
	I thought the drill was going off track. This was a warning and I then was very 
	careful to remove chips often. As more holes were drilled I realized when I put my 
	head down to look at the drill from the side, it always looked crooked. How I love 
	my astigmatism!
</p>

<p>
	I am worried about the cube with the two bungled pockets. The hole was drilled 
	between them and the center drill had to drill out some of the ledge in the corner 
	as it entered the flat. The flat is not at the same height as the other holes and 
	is has ledges on both sides. I am not sure the hinge will sit well enough to function. 
	I have one cube that is 0.753" from cut face to cut face. We will see if milling the 
	cut faces flat and square will leave it too short for use. After milling both sides 
	the cube is about 0.012" shorter in one dimension. This should be acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	The cube was set up against the stop and the four pockets were milled with care 
	taken to make sure it was the same enantiomer (handedness) as the one it replaces. 
	The holes were drilled as before. The edges were all chamfered with the two edges 
	along the hinges chamfered deeper. The eight cubes are complete.
</p>

<p>
	The links or hinge pin connectors will be made next. They will be 3/8" long and 1/8" 
	wide. The two holes will be 3/16" apart. The plan is to begin with strips of 1/16" 
	stainless steel, drill the holes and cut to separate links. Sanding, using a jig, 
	will reduce all to the final shape and dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	The first order of business is cutting 8" of 3/16" wide stainless steel strips. The 
	410 stainless steel is left over from the 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Pen.html">pen project</a>, 
	almost a square foot remains.
</p>

<p>
	Dykem was painted on one edge of the stainless steel sheet. A caliper was used to 
	scratch a line at 3/16" along the edge. The hacksaw was used to cut along this line. 
	The first picture shows the cutting in progress. The second shows the two cut strips.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC steel strips.heic" alt="Two strips cut from the sheet stock." width="1250" height="1613">

<p>
	The two strips were marked out using a combination of 1-2-3 blocks and the height 
	marking blocks made long ago (shown below). The marks were made every 3/8". The 
	second photo shows the marked out strips.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC marked strips.heic" alt="Cutting the strips from stainless steel sheet." width="2738" height="1635">

<p>
	After returning from a week with family in Puerto Vallarta, I started the sanding 
	needed to narrow these strips to 1/8". Oy!! The old 80 grit belt on the sander was 
	almost smooth. A new belt was installed, but it is only 120 grit. The parts can only 
	be held on the belt for 10-15 seconds before they get too hot, even twhen held with 
	pliers. The sanding is very slow and at least an 1/8" has to be removed. I need to 
	trust my hacksawing more.
</p>

<p>
	Significant sanding later and water cooling every fifteen seconds both strips of 
	stainless steel are now 1/8" wide. The long strip was clamped to a piece of wood 
	with two clamps and held in the vise. The center drill left only a small mark. The 
	steel had hardened during the sanding! Back to the hacksaw.
</p>

<p>
	Two 6" long strips of stainless steel were cut from the sheet 3/16" wide. Both were 
	deburred. One was sufficient for the sixteen parts. One strip was affixed to a long 
	strip of Baltic birch plywood using carpet tape. This was held on parallels in the 
	mill vise. The spindle was centered over the end of steel strip and advanced about 
	0.08", a bit over the 1/16" needed. A hole was center drilled and then drilled 
	through with a #51 drill.
</p>

<p>
	The table was advanced 0.188" and the drilling was repeated. After about fifteen holes 
	(all 0.188" apart) the #51 drill started complaining. It was easily replaced from the 
	drill stash in the garage with a sharp one. The remainder of the holes went smoothly, 
	though boring. The strip was long enough for the required sixteen parts and one extra, 
	34 holes. The photo below shows the strip in the middle of the drilling process.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC strip drilling.heic" alt="Drilling the strip of stainless steel sheet." width="1971" height="1844">

<p>
	The steel strip still attached to the strip of plywood was held in the shop vise. A C-clamp 
	held the strip more firmly in place and a cut was made between parts with a hacksaw. 
	The strip was shifted in the vise and the C-clamp moved close to the cut for each 
	successive cut. At the end of cutting the part there were only sixteen parts; not 
	sure where the extra went. The drilled holes were deburred with a file. This took 
	as long as cutting them apart. The first photo below shows the cutting setup and the 
	second shows the deburred parts ready for sanding to shape.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC strip cutting.heic" alt="Cutting the links from the strip of stainless steel sheet." width="2696" height="1802">
<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC rough links.heic" alt="The stainless steel links ready for sanding to shape." width="1225" height="1369">

<p>
	A jig was made for sanding the links to the appropriate width. A notch was cut in 
	the previously used and now shortened strip of Baltic birch plywood. An aluminum scrap 
	fit in the notch and sits flat on the sanding table, when the wood strip rides in 
	the table's track. The end of the aluminum was sanded flush when the jig was in the 
	track. The end was then drilled for two holes, 3/16" apart and 1/16" in from the 
	sanded edge. The holes were drilled with the #51 drill and two #0-80 screws were used 
	with nuts to serve as pins for holding the links. A link was placed on the jig and 
	the jig was pressed tight to the front edge of the track, the wood is narrower than 
	the track it rides in, sanding off one side of the link. The sanding disk is 120 grit. 
	The first photo shows the jig and the second shows the jig in use.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC link jig.heic" alt="The jig used to hold the links for sanding to width." width="2274" height="1857">
<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC link sanding.heic" alt="The jig in use sanding a link." width="1832" height="1916">

<p>
	After successfully narrowing all of the links to 1/8" the jig was converted to a 
	corner rounding jig. One screw was removed. A strip of brass was drilled with a #50 
	drill 1/16" in from the end. A second hole was drilled 3/16" further in. A 0-80 screw 
	was put through the hole in the brass strip and locked in place with a nut. The strip 
	was placed over the pivot screw in the jig body and held loosely with a nut. The 
	revamped jig was placed on the table and the strip's end was sanded round. A link was 
	placed on the two screws, the jig held on the table, and the strip was rotated first 
	in one direction and then in the other, rounding over both corners of one end. 
	Flipping and repeating turned the rectangular links into ovals. The first photo shows 
	the modified jig, the second shows it in use and the third shows the pile of oval 
	links.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC oval links.heic" alt="The sixteen links sanded to ovals via a jig." width="1415" height="1566">

<p>
	The links require sanding and polishing after the rather intense heat from the 
	sanding. Most have turned an interesting shade of tan from the heat. Both sides of 
	each link were sanded with 600 grit sandpaper. Further sanding with 1000 and 2000 
	grit made little observable difference, so sanding was stopped at 600. The photo 
	shows a pile of sanded links. I couldn't resist linking two blocks and the second 
	photo shows them held in place with screws dropped through. The 0-80 screws are 
	not long enough to use them with nuts. There is decent play between the blocks.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC finished links.heic" alt="The sixteen links sanded to remove the stain from the heat." width="1162" height="1125">
<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC linked.heic" alt="Two blocks held together with two screws through the link." width="1208" height="915">

<p class="note">
	In fact what am I going to use as the rods between links? I can't believe I have not 
	thought of this until now. The smallest rod I have is 3/32" brass. I don't want to 
	peen thirty-two rod ends, so am exploring machine screws. I can purchase 3/4" thread 
	length screws, but that is probably 1/16" too long necessitating lathe shortening. 
	Either locknuts or thread locker should hold the nuts without hindering movement.
</p>

<br/>

<p class="note">
	Another concern is weight. Mitxela indicates that the set of cubes is pretty heavy 
	for a handheld toy. Holding all of the cubes in one hand confirms this opinion. One 
	possibility is drilling all six faces of each cube with a 3/8" drill to a 1/8" depth. 
	This would reduce the volume of the cube by 20%, probably not sufficient for the 
	effort. Drilling through from two directions with a 3/8" drill would reduce the weight 
	by a third.
</p>

<p>
	The screws were ordered this morning, #0-80&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4". Meanwhile, cube weight 
	reductions were explored. The extra damaged cube was centered in the four-jaw chuck 
	to within 0.001". It was center drilled, drilled with a #6 drill, followed by a 
	9/32" drill, and then a 3/8" drill. The weight was reduced from 55 g to 43 g, per 
	calculations. Second and then third orthogonal holes were drilled. With only two the 
	cube looked unfinished. The holes were lightly chamfered with the hand-held tool. The 
	first photo below shows the drilling setup and the second photo the thrice drilled 
	cube. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC cube drill.heic" alt="The extra cube set up in the chuck for drilling." width="1012" height="1250">
<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC test cube.heic" alt="The drilled test cube with three orthogonal holes." width="1019" height="1221">

<p class="note">
	The drilled cube weighed in at 28 g! So instead of the entire toy weighing almost 
	one pound it will now weigh half of a pound.
</p>

<p>
	A few different sanding protocols were explored on the extra cube. 400 grit was 
	followed by 600 grit to give a matte appearance. 1000 and 2000 grit were then used 
	and the polish was good, but not great. All unsanded faces were sanded to 600 and 
	then all faces were polished on the buffing wheel with red rouge. This produced a 
	nice shine as expected. 
</p>

<p>
	Two modifications need to be incorporated while drilling. First, the holes should be 
	reamed to 3/8". This will give a much nicer finish on the internal surfaces. Second, 
	the part needs to be held in the chuck with a parallel or spider behind it. The 
	machined corners can allow the part to twist in the chuck. This was noticed when 
	chamfering the holes.
</p>

<p>
	The first of the blocks was placed in the chuck over a spider. All three holes were 
	drilled, reamed, and chamfered. This was repeated for the rest of the blocks. About 
	twenty minutes per block, but they were completed and look good as shown in the photo 
	below. They are also significantly lighter as planned.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC trice drilled.heic" alt="The drilled cubes with three orthogonal holes." width="1448" height="1266">

<p>
	Began the hand sanding by sanding all 48 sides with 400 grit sandpaper. The sanding 
	was continued with 600 grit paper. A Sharpie dot was put on each side to more 
	easily distinguish which sides had not been sanded. The next step was polishing all 
	with red rouge on the buffing wheel. The photo below shows the halfway point in 
	polishing. The remainder were buffed and all checked and in some cases rebuffed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="infcube/IFC polishing.heic" alt="The cubes after sending to 600 grit and polishing half." width="2887" height="1758">

<p>
	Spent about three hours cleaning the cubes of the buffing residue. First they were 
	rinsed with an aqueous solution of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and then scrubbed with soap and 
	water. A towel and a pipe cleaner were used to clean all of the openings. There was 
	significant residue in the 3/8" drilled holes to remove. After a second wash with 
	soapy water the cubes were rinsed with water and then with acetone. Gloves were worn 
	from this point on. 
</p>

<p>
	The faces and bevels of the cubes were painted with Protecta-Clear varnish. They 
	were hung on a copper wire held in the vise to dry. They were recoated after an
	intermediate 45 minute drying period. The brush was cleaned after each use with 
	lacquer thinner. (Xylene is recommended for cleaning.) The photo below shows the 
	cubes after the first coat of varnish. The second coat dried for 24 hours before 
	the cubes were taken down from the wire. The second photo shows the completed cubes 
	and links. Now I just have to wait patiently for the screws to arrive allowing 
	assembly and more importantly fiddling with the assembled toy.

<p>
	The screws finally arrived on the seventeenth. I immediately began shortening them. 
	They need to be shortened by about 1/16". The lathe screw holder was tried first. 
	The screw did not run true. After a few other unsuccessful attempts via different 
	methods, the following method was adopted. Two nuts are threaded onto the screw and 
	tightened together. A 0-80 die is threaded onto the screw. The screw is held in the 
	vise via the two nuts with the die pressed tight against the side of the jaws. The 
	screw is cut with a hacksaw. Removing the die cleans up the threads! The process is 
	slow, mostly because it is so difficult to work with such small parts in my fat and 
	clumsy fingers. The job will need to be finished tomorrow morning, when I am raring 
	to go. Below is a photo of a successfully assembled linkage, probably not a correct 
	pairing.

	The screws were tackled this morning, while listening to some jazz fusion. The 
	distraction was a necessity. Each screw had two nuts put on and locked together. 
	Then the 0-80 die was put on with the labeled side toward the end to be cut. About 
	1/8" of screw protruded from the die. The whole thing was put in the vise with 
	the die flat against the side of the jaws. About 1/16" was cut off with the hacksaw. 
	After removing the die the nuts were usually trivial to remove. Many screws later the 
	job was done. Below is a photo of a screw ready for cutting.

	Test assembly was next. First the cubes were sorted into the two groups of enantiomers. 
	The cubes were then set up in the correct fashion for attaching per a diagram I had 
	sketched. The cubes were assembled into pairs first as seen in the first photo below. 
	Then the pairs were attached. One link needed to be filed so it would move freely. 
	One link did not seem to have sufficient spacing between the two holes, but I was 
	able to make it work. Holding cubes, screws, links and attaching nuts was quite the 
	challenge for my clumsy fingers. Eventually the eight cubes were attached as shown 
	in the second and third photos below. Glueing the nuts in place will be tackled at a 
	future date.

	The later date was today, three days later. It took 1&nbsp;1/2 hours to put the 
	blocks back together with a drop of blue Loctite in each tiny nut. A dental pick was 
	used to apply the tiny drop of glue. The glue requires 24 hours to completely dry.
