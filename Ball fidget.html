<p class=first>
	My middle son has been making a variety of fidgets with his 3D printer. He 
	particularly likes one he keeps in his pocket, a simple ball trapped in a groove. 
	The only thing he does not like about it is its heft, too light. I will make him 
	one of brass with plenty of heft.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/BLF ball fidget.heic" alt="The 3D printed ball fidget" width="1440" height="978">

<p>
	After some consideration on ways to make this fidget with its trapped ball, I settled 
	on the following. A 3" length of 3/4" brass round was cut from stock and faced on 
	both ends. One end was center drilled, drilled up to a T drill, and reamed 3/8" to a 
	depth of 1&nbsp;3/8".
</p>

<p>
	The rod was held in the milling vise and one side reduced by 0.125" creating a flat 
	with 1/16" left between the new face and the hole. The milling was done with a 3/8" 
	two flute end mill in 0.010" passes. The last pass of 0.005" was done very slowly 
	producing a good finish. The first photo shows the milling in progress and the second 
	the completed bottom face of the fidget.
</p>

<p>
	A plug was made for the hole. A 3/4" length of 3/8" brass rod was cut off and held 
	in the lathe chuck. A 5/16" ball end mill was held in the drill chuck mounted in the 
	tailstock. The end mill was slowly fed into the brass rod as it was spinning 
	producing a round pocket in the end of the rod. The remaining edge around the hole 
	was faced and a short length of the rod was parted off at 1/4". The plug is shown 
	below. The plug needs to be soldered in place, but this won't happen until the 
	top has been mostly milled to depth and the purchased ball arrives and is put in 
	place.
</p>

<p>
	The top was milled similarly to the bottom done previously. About 1/64" of material 
	was left between the top and the hole. No attempt was made to leave a nice finish as 
	more material will be milled from the top after inserting the ball and plug. The 
	sides were milled next as holding the part in a vise after inserting the ball would be a 
	challenge. They were both milled about 0.05" deep leaving a corner with the top edge 
	and a bit of the original brass round side at the bottom. Both were left with a finish 
	similar to the bottom. The first picture below shows the milled bottom and the second 
	the part after milling the sides.

<p>
	One of the ten purchased 440 stainless steel hardened balls, shown below, was placed 
	in the hole, but was too tight to roll freely, the point of this fidget. Ten minutes 
	of sanding with 400 grit sandpaper rolled around a 1/4" rod gave a nice sliding fit, 
	hampered only by air pressure. The plug was inserted and soldered into position as 
	seen in the photo below. The part was left to cool.
</p>

<p>
	The plugged end was finished with an end mill to get rid of the solder and tarnish. 
	The top was milled down until an opening with ball was just noticed at the central 
	end, as seen below. The end opposite that with the ball was then milled an additional 
	0.040" with the ball stuck in place. The ball was then moved to the plugged end of 
	the device and the rest of the top was milled to the same depth.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/BLF taped ball.heic" alt="The stainless steel ball taped into the end to mill the rest" width="1706" height="1356">

<p>
	The opening had quite a sharp edge, so the edges were trimmed flat with a 4 flute 3/16" 
	end mill. All of the outside edges were heavily chamfered with a file. The entire 
	fidget was sanded with 220, 320, 400, and 600 grit sandpaper. The ball moves nicely, 
	but does get stuck in the plugged end. After working the ball back and forth the 
	movement is very smooth.
