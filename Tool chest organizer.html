<p class=first>
	I have decided to tackle something that has been bothering me for some time, the 
	state of disorganization of tools on top of my tool chest. This space is my workspace 
	when in the "closet shop" working with the mill or lathe. This morning I will 
	organize this mess. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="toolCO/TCO tool mess.heic" alt="The mess of tools demanding organization" width="2927" height="2370">

<p>
	A list of the tools was made along with their relevant dimensions. The available 
	space is 11&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;17" if the drills, black box barely seen behind 
	the Dykem at the top of the photo, are moved behind the granite 
	block. The tools were pictorially laid out on a space this size indicating it is 
	sufficient for the job. A scrap of 3/4" pine was located that is 
	11&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;16". It should be a bit thicker for setting in some of the 
	tools, so was topped with scraps of 1/4" particle board. This glue-up is shown 
	below.
</p>

<p>
	The glued up board is a bit too wide so with the table saw was trimmed to fit. The 
	proposed recesses for the tools were drawn onto the board, seen below. The recesses 
	were either drilled or routed and chiseled to an appropriate depth for each tool.
</p>

<p>
	The larger recesses near the edges were routed out with a 1/2" end mill in the mill. 
	The smaller recesses were routed using a bit in the Dremel. Rectangles not near an 
	edge were cleaned out using a chisel. Two holes were drilled with spade bits and the 
	largest hole was cleaned out using a chisel. A fence was used for many of the longer 
	recesses and this setup is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="toolCO/TCO fence.heic" alt="The fence set up for routing the long ruler slots" width="2886" height="1759">

<p>
	The router bits used ranged from 1/16" to 1/8". One 1/16" slot needed to go 3/4" deep, 
	but the bit was only 1/4" long. The slot was chain drilled by hand after routing to 
	1/4" depth. The excess material was removed with an Xacto knife. The board after 
	completing all of the recesses is seen below. Only one recess is not quite sufficient 
	to hold the tool, tweezers. They need to be put in point down to avoid getting poked, 
	but when installed they flop from side to side. The recess was deepened and now the 
	tweezers are better supported.
</p>

<p>
	The top surface of the tool organizer was sanded with 120 grit sandpaper and then 
	treated with three coats of wipe-on polyurethane. The MDF could probably use ten as
	it seemed so porous. The two photos below show the completed organizer. Plenty of 
	room is available for any new layout tools I seem to collect and make.
