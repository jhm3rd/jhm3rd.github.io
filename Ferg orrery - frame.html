<p class=first>
	The frame for this orrery will not simply be two brass rectangles. The plan is to 
	begin the top and bottom with some included circles and cut designs into the 
	shaped brass parts with a jeweler's saw. Two opposite edges near the middle of the 
	frame need to be left straight to attach the side panels needed to support the 
	three idler gears. Ideally, the side panels will also have pierced designs, that 
	either hide or accentuate the screws holding the idler supports. An initial sketch 
	is shown below to provide some idea of where this is going. A piece from Mike Duber, 
	engraver extraordinaire, is the source of most of the ideas.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 design ideas.heic" alt="Design ideas for the frame of the Ferguson Orrery" width="2825" height="3506">

<p>
	The design was finalized a day later. The photo below is a mishmash of the top and 
	bottom frames. The pointer at one end and the <em>fleur de lis</em> at the other in the 
	photo will be part of the bottom frame. The scroll work and side embellishments 
	will be for the top frame. The scroll cut into the large circle will have a mirror 
	image on the other side. Both frames will have the two circles. A flat is left in the 
	middle of the top and bottom frames on one side to attach the shelf support.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 design.heic" alt="The final design for the top and bottom frames of the Ferguson Orrery" width="1831" height="2324">

<p>
	The next step is determining whether I am capable of cutting scrollwork into a 3/16" 
	thick slab of brass scrap. China white was painted onto the brass with a bit of spit 
	and a simple design was drawn onto the brass. The design was cut in one one side and 
	out the same. The cutting went well as seen in the two pictures below. To do this 
	correctly the chips will need to be blown away constantly as they obscure the cutting 
	line. The huffing and puffing was no fun and was insufficient to keep me on the line. 
	An aquarium pump will be used assuming I can find some Tygon or other appropriate 
	tubing. I also need to use my magnifiers!
</p>

<p>
	Was unable to find the tubing I know we have, but believe it is too big anyway for 
	the port on the aquarium pump. I spotted an unused orange extension cord and a crazy idea 
	came to mind. A two to three foot length of the cord was removed and slit down the 
	side with a razor. The three wires inside and the insulation were removed. The split 
	was covered and closed with electrician's tape. The tube fits tightly in the pump's 
	port and it was plugged in. Unfortunately the air coming out of the pump is so 
	minimal that the brass dust was unmoved. Even without the tubing the pump did not 
	blow off the brass dust!
</p>

<p>
	Onward we forge. The optivisor with light was was worn and this made a huge difference, 
	especially the light (after installing new batteries). A cut was completed in a scrap 
	of 1/4" brass and the resulting cut is seen below. Add an eye and the plant becomes 
	a dove.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 leaf test.heic" alt="The results of cutting out a leaf from 1/4 inch brass" width="1442" height="1333">

<p>
	I will start with the bottom frame as it is a little simpler. It requires almost 7" 
	of 2&nbsp;3/8" wide brass. The top plate will need 2&nbsp;5/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4&nbsp;1/2" 
	of 1/4" brass. The brass plate purchased, 2" wide, is not wide enough to handle this 
	frame design, especially the flourishes extending from the circles. I will try 
	soldering a 1/2" strip onto the 2" stock for the bottom plate. Most of this joint 
	will be hidden, so shouldn't matter. If it looks good enough the top will be done 
	similarly.
</p>

<p>
	A scrap of brass was cut to approximately 3/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2&nbsp;3/8". After wiping 
	both edges down with acetone the strip was clamped to the edge of the 7" length of 
	brass about 2" from one end. Flux was applied to both sides of the joint and 
	short lengths of solder were placed along the joint. The brass was heated with a 
	propane torch, bottom and top, until the solder melted and penetrated the joint. 
	The two photos below, first the top and then the bottom, show the still hot joint. 
	The joint was cleaned up with sandpaper.
</p>

<p>
	The part's circles were sketched onto the brass using a compass after marking the 
	centers using a tracing of the part with allowances for the two end protrusions. The 
	part was roughly cut out with a hacksaw providing at least 1/8" allowance. The 
	holes were drilled and reamed to 1/4". The part was then setup on the rotary table 
	and the sides of the circles were cut to the line, 0.995" and 1.300" offsets for the 
	small and large circle using a 1/4" four flute end mill. The first photo below shows 
	the setup and the second the milled arcs.

<p>
	The <em>fleur de lis</em> was traced onto the China white covered brass using tracing 
	paper and carbon paper. The carbon paper image was faint and had to be traced over 
	with a pencil. The outside of the design was cut in about 3 hours of interrupted work. 
	I learned while cutting as the later cuts went more smoothly, quickly and with fewer 
	broken blades. The photo below shows the outside of the <em>fleur de lis</em> 
	completed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 fleur outside.heic" alt="The fleur de lis outer cuts completed" width="1646" height="1437">

<p class="note">
	One modification to the process that seemed to help me stay on line was stoning the 
	sides of the blade before use. A coarse diamond stone was run along both sides of 
	the blade prior to installing the blade in the jeweler's saw.
</p>

<p>
	The <em>fleur de lis</em> was drilled with a #60 drill using the sensitive drilling 
	jig as shown in the first photo below. This was followed by cutting out the inside 
	of the design seen in the second photo.

<p>
	The pointer end was covered with China white and the pointer drawn on using the 
	tracing and carbon paper. The outside was cut first followed by drilling, #60 and #50 
	for the inner openings. Some of the inner cuts were cut with the blade installed with 
	the teeth facing into the jeweler's saw and cut while pushing as the saw is not deep 
	enough to accomodate the full length of the part. After cutting, work with assorted 
	files completed the pointer. This work is documented in the photos below.

<p>
	The orrery bottom frame was mostly finished with two processes. Two lines were 
	engraved to denote a "rope" crossing another as shown in the first photo below. (More 
	engraved lines might be appropriate.) The frame was then sanded with 120 to 600 grit 
	sandpaper. This sanded bottom frame is seen in the second photo below.
</p>

<p>
	A slight change in plans, the top frame will be made out of 3/16" brass. A 3" wide 
	piece of this is at hand. This should also be easier to saw and a lot of sawing with 
	the jeweler's saw is in store for this part. A 4&nbsp;1/4" length of this brass was 
	quickly cut with the hacksaw. The design, chubby baby, was traced onto tracing paper 
	and is seen below. As with the bottom frame the first task will be drilling the circle 
	centers and using the rotary table to mill most of the curves.
</p>

<p>
	New Year's day and I am ready to continue this project, having skipped partying last 
	night. After first repairing the mill, the z-axis dial was loose as near the top of its 
	travel it gets very tight, the outer lines of chubby baby were transfered to the 
	brass rectangle. The hole centers were punched, drilled and reamed to 1/4". Much 
	time was spent trying to use the rotary table plate to hold this large part on the 
	small table. After much gnashing of teeth the plate was switched out for the two 
	extensions. With these in place the part was easy to clamp in two spots for milling 
	the arcs. The large arc was milled first, followed by the smaller arc. The first 
	photo below shows the setup for milling the large arc. The next two photos show the 
	completed large arc and then both completed.

	The external decorations were completed this morning. First the design on the side 
	with the flat were cut, requiring one hole drilled. The design on the opposite side 
	was cut next and also required one hole to be drilled. The part was sanded from 220 
	to 600 grit and the two photos below document these two cuts. (The flat still 
	requires filing so it is actually flat.)

<p>
	After a few day off for various reasons the first scroll was cut this morning. It 
	took about two hours. My biggest challenge was where to drill the holes for access 
	and avoid cutting where the part does not fit. I should probably purchase a jeweler's 
	saw with deeper access for situations like this. In any event after a bit of filing 
	the scroll looks pretty decent. For some reason I am enjoying this work. Picture 
	below is of the backside ?? of the scroll.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 first scroll.heic" alt="The first scroll on the left side of the top; backside is shown" width="1419" height="1433">

<p>
	The second scroll was transfered and cut this morning. As can be seen it was meant to 
	be a mirror image of the first. It comes close. It is shown below after some filing 
	and sanding. The cutouts are kind of cool, but I don't know what they would be good 
	for.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 second scroll.heic" alt="The second scroll on the right side of the top" width="1492" height="1705">

<p>
	Part of the morning was spent determining the size and drilling pattern for the 
	shelf support. Washers also need to be made to support and separate the gears. Eight 
	1/32" washers will be needed to stand the gears up off of the bases and shelves. An 
	additional four washers; 1 - 1/4" & 3 - 9/32" are needed to separate the gears in 
	the fixed stack.
</p>

<p>
	A quick sketch of the shelf support layout was made. Two holes will be drilled for 
	the 1/4" top and bottom and for each of the shelves. These holes will be centered, in 
	distance from the bottom edge, at 1/8", 7/8", 1&nbsp;9/32", 1&nbsp;11/16", and 
	2&nbsp;1/8". The shelf itself will be 2&nbsp;1/4" long. 
</p>

<p>
	A slight problem was diskovered upon aligning the completed bottom and top with a 
	1/4" pin in one hole. The two flats do not align in either direction. The top is 
	1/16" further from center than the bottom and the centers of the two flats are 5/8" 
	apart. The latter is easily seen in the photo below with the centers of the flats 
	marked.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 flat offset.heic" alt="Showing the unintended offset between the two flats for the shelf support" width="1733" height="1364">

<p>
	This challenge presents the opportunity to create a feature that I was hoping to 
	somehow incorporate. The rectangular shelf support would have looked off amongst 
	all of the curves this orrery already possesses. Consequently, this error will 
	become a feature, a curved shelf support system. This should pose no problem in 
	positioning the gears correctly. The photo below shows a rough sketch of the planned 
	shelf support.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 ss crude.heic" alt="A rough sketch of the shelf support" width="1606" height="1480">

<p>
	A piece of 3/16"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2" brass was cut from scrap. The ends were squared up 
	and the piece was shortened to 2&nbsp;1/4" in the mill. The height gauge was used 
	to mark out the lines for the holes. Two lines were scribed at an angle to offset 
	the top from the bottom by 5/8" and to set the width at 7/8". The holes were then 
	marked 7/32" inside these lines. The photo below shows the holes laid out on the 
	brass stock.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 hole locs.heic" alt="The hole locations marked on the brass for the shelf support" width="1518" height="1626">

<p class="note">
	The reflection of the fingers holding the camera is a nice touch.
</p>

<p>
	The holes were drilled as through holes for 2-56 screws with a #40 drill in short 
	order as seen in the photo below. Now back to the drawing board. A design was 
	sketched out and transfered to the back side of the brass blank. This is seen in the 
	second photo below.

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 support design.heic" alt="The design sketched on the brass shelf support" width="1658" height="1754">

<p>
	Cutting proceeded well and the part was completely cut in about two hours. It was 
	sanded to 600 grit and is shown in the photo below sitting on a scrap of purpleheart. 
	I have to admit being pretty impressed with the completed shelf support. Of course, 
	installing the part will require drilling right through the ornamentation on chubby 
	baby's back as the flat is hidden behind the two leaves.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 support.heic" alt="The cut and sanded shelf support" width="1106" height="1424">

<p>
	The shelf support was held in place against the bottom frame and the holes were 
	marked on the bottom frame with a punch. The holes were drilled 1/4" deep and threaded 
	2-56. The support needs a spacer between it and the bottom frame so one was quickly 
	fashioned from a scrap of 1/16" brass. A 1/8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" piece was cut, punched 
	and drilled with through holes. The corners were filed off to remain hidden behind 
	the support. The first photo below shows the two frame members on carriage bolts to 
	mimic their final separation, 1&nbsp;27/32". The support installed onto the two 
	frames is seen in the second photo.

<p>
	Drilling was not the best way to provide access to holes behind the decorative leaves. 
	Grinding was chosen for this task. A diamond burr was installed in the dremel and 
	used to carefully grind away the excess marked on the side of the brass leaves. It 
	was more effective than expected. The first hole was marked in the mockup, drilled 
	and tapped as seen in the photo below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 frame tapped.heic" alt="The top frame drilled and tapped for the support screw" width="1505" height="1454">

<p>
	The second hole required more grinding to provide the necessary access for the drill 
	and tap. The hex head screws could not be used to hold the support to the top frame 
	as there was no access for a wrench, so two SHC screws of the correct size were prepped. 
	When drilling, the second hole was too close to the bottom of the frame and broke 
	through when tapping, shown in the first photo. Luckily the hole still works as 
	planned and the support installed between the two frames is seen below. That was a 
	nice example of working on a wing and a prayer (not my favorite way of working!), but 
	successful to boot.

<p>
	Four 1.5"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3/4" pieces of aluminum were hacksawed from 1/8" aluminum stock. 
	They were squared up in the mill as a unit resulting in four 0.697"&nbsp;X&nbsp;1.390" 
	rectangles as shown below. An end of each was blued with a Sharpie and marked with a 
	centerline using the height gage. The holes in the support are 7/16" apart, so the 
	four ends were marked again with the height gage at 0.130" and 0.567" from one end 
	for the two tapped holes.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 cut shelves.heic" alt="The shelves cut from 1/8 inch aluminum stock" width="1671" height="1098">

<p>
	The holes were drilled with the parts still clamped in a block using the new DRO. 
	What a treat! The holes were then tapped 2-56 with a regular tap and then a bottoming 
	tap. A bit of deburring and the shelves were completed, though probably need some 
	sanding. The two photos below show the drilled block of parts and three shelves 
	installed. The shelves need some sanding and a way needs to be found to install the 
	shelf screws without scratching the brass support.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 shelves installed.heic" alt="The shelves installed on the support" width="1791" height="1417">

<p>
	Looking at the installed shelves immediately revealed an issue. Anybody see it? 
	Anybody? The shelves are not in the correct positions to support the idler gears!!!
	Who designed this thing anyway? New shelves are the next task. They need to angle 
	back from their juncture with the support by as much as 3/4" from their current 
	locations.
</p>

<p>
	A second set of shelves were made with a kink. They were rough cut from 1&nbsp;1/2" 
	wide aluminum stock and then milled to final shape. The ends were drilled as before. 
	These shelves are seen in the photo below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 new shelves.heic" alt="The new bent shelves drilled for a 2-56 thread" width="1168" height="1216">

<p>
	A wrench was made of aluminum for installing the screws without marring the brass. A 
	quick milling job beginning with a 1/4" square cross section of aluminum. One end was 
	thinned to 0.10" and then a 1/8" slot was milled in the end. The corners were 
	slightly rounded. This wrench is seen in the first photo and the shelves installed 
	using it in the second. The third photo shows how the new shelves sit squarely 
	between the two gear axle hole locations.

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 centered.heic" alt="The shelf ends centered between the holes for the gear axles" width="2072" height="1823">

<p>
	Spacers for the gears need to be made to hold them up off of the frame or the shelves. 
	They also need to prop up the gears to the same height as their mates. The distances 
	between the bottom frame and the bottom shelf is 17/32". The gaps between shelves 
	are both 9/32" and the gap between the top shelf and top frame is 1/4". 1/32" 
	washers will be used below all gears that sit directly on shelf or frame, similar 
	thickness washers will be used between the two central gears of the bottom set.
</p>

<p>
	The gears on the left and in the middle will need washers and separators. The 
	driven stack will all be secured to their tube at the correct height. Consequently, 
	seven 1/32" washers, one 1/16" washer, one 17/32" separator, and three 7/32" 
	separators are needed. All of the gears needing these supports currently have 1/4" 
	center holes execpt for the 11 tooth gear with a 1/8" hole. All except for one 1/32" 
	washer will require 1/4" holes. The total is 1.438" of tube needed plus 
	0.04"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11 cuts equals 1.88" of tube made from 3/8" rod.
</p>

<p>
	A 2&nbsp;1/2" length of 3/8" drill rod was put in the three jaw chuck in the lathe. 
	The free end was faced and the rod was drilled up to an F drill, 0.257" for a distance 
	of 1". A series of spacers were parted off. The rod was then drilled an additional 
	inch and the remainder of the spacers were prepared. After completing the lot of 
	them, plus a few extra 1/32" washers, they were deburred. All were measured and all 
	are oversized relative to plan by about 0.01". The photo below shows the spacers.
</p>

<p>
	The 17/32" spacer made above was a misread of the admittedly incomprensible plans 
	and was shortened to 0.25". A test assembly was then done with the spacers and the 
	driving gears. The driven gears were put in as well for the heck of it, though their 
	spacing will be managed when they are affixed to the tubes. The photo below shows 
	this mockup.  A nice fit for the driving gears between shelves.

<p>
	The first photo below documents another issue diskovered. The screw won't fit in 
	the top hole because the 47 tooth gear, third from right, runs into the shelf 
	support. The support was marked, removed from the assembly and the marks extended 
	across the width as seen in the second photo.

<p>
	The support was clamped onto the top of the vise as it is a bit too big to be held 
	by the vise. Two strap clamps held it with the slot square to the mill. Squaring was 
	accomplished by moving the end mill above the lines and ensuring it stayed between 
	the two lines marking the slot. A 3/16" end mill was used to cut the slot to 1/16" 
	depth. The slot was then widened on either side by 0.025". The photo shows the slot 
	cut in the shelf support. The gear spins freely through the slot when aligned with 
	its partner driving gear.

<p>
	Determining how to mark the shelves for the idler gear centers is a challenge. The 
	middle gears in the bottom should be easier as there is easy access. The shelves 
	need to be marked for position, and then carefully measured from the two axles. A 
	jig will need to be prepared to hold the shelf with two axle centers for marking.
</p>

<p>
	The position of the middle gears for the moon were approached first as it seemed 
	simplest. Since it is difficult to measure the distance from the center of a hole, a 
	plug was made. A length of 1/4" brass rod was faced and sanded to fit in the holes 
	in the base. A tiny divot was made in the center of the end with the 30&deg; 
	engraving tool made for the pantograph. Two mating gears, 11 & 63, were placed on the 
	depthing tool and an easy fit was located. An arc was scribed on the blued base. The 
	other pair of gears, 18 & 42, for this same gear train was then put on the depthing 
	tool. Again an arc was scribed, though I already recognized yet another design error.
	The gears on the depthing tool are seen in the first photo and the non-intersecting 
	arcs in the second.

<p class="note">
	A niggling issue has been driving me crazy with these gears. They do not want to fit 
	on the standard 1/4" shafts I have used for every other gear made. The holes all seem 
	just a little undersized. Maybe it is time for a new 1/4" reamer. And while I am at 
	it, I should also purchase oversized and undersized reamers for a complete set.
</p>

<p>
	A piece of brass scrap, perhaps the one cut out of the base was found that fit well. 
	Checking the extensions of the arcs on this scrap showed it was sufficiently large 
	to serve the purpose of supporting an axle, though an axle that is only 1/8" diameter. 
	Soldering the scrap in place will have to wait until the garage warms to at least 
	freezing.
</p>

<p>
	Not quite freezing, but the soldering is fast. I preferred a better fit than that 
	seen above so a scrap of brass was marked with the 
	curve to be filled and cut with the jeweler's saw. A bit of filing and it fit quite 
	well. After figuring out how to clamp the parts in the basement vise, they were 
	moved to the garage vise and are seen clamped in the first photo below. The parts 
	were fluxed and then soldered. After cooling the piece was washed and the joint is 
	seen in the second photo.

<p>
	The top face of the bottom frame was sanded up to 400 grit, shown below, and then 
	painted with blue layout fluid. Using the insert for the holes the part was again 
	marked for the axle of the central two gears of the bottom four with the depthing 
	tool. In setting the tool up for the 11 & 63 tooth gears it was diskovered that 
	the previous measurement was not done with the 11 tooth gear! It has a 1/8" center 
	hole and the depthing tool has a 1/4" axle! An additional axle was made for the 
	depthing tool by turning a length of 1/4" drill rod to a point and reducing the 
	opposite end to 0.1245" for a length of 1/4", using a collet to insure concentricity. 
	The two intersecting arcs are shown in the photo below. Notice the intersection is 
	intersecting the new joint!

<p>
	The excess soldered addition was cut off with the jeweler's saw and the hole, now 
	plugged with solder, was opened and retapped. The plan for this gear axle is to drill 
	a 1/4" hole, insert the 1/4" axle and solder or set screw it in place. After 
	diskovering yet another error and bad decision making, the project will be shelved 
	for a while.
</p>

<p>
	After a thirteen day break to recharge and make the jeweler's file handle this project 
	was reinitialized. A scrap of 1/4" brass was painted blue and the shape of the correct 
	side was scratched onto its surface with a scribe. The jeweler's saw was used to 
	cut the curve. A bit of filing was needed to perfect the fit. With the piece installed 
	the angle between its flat edge and the flat edge on the opposite side of the part 
	was measured to be 10&deg;. A scrap of aluminum was milled to 10&deg; using the angle 
	table. The aluminum, the brass insert and the bottom frame were all held in the 
	vise in the cold garage. Flux was applied followed by a string of solder bits. The 
	part was heated from the bottom until the solder melted and penetrated the joint. 
	The entire part, including edges both inside and outside, was sanded to 400 grit. 
	This process is documented in the series of photos below.

	It is interesting how the copper in the brass rises to the surface when the brass is

	I am returning to this project after working on the 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Wooden%20rings.html">wooden rings</a>. 
	The next step is marking each of the levels for the gears. The bottom gear set, was 
	marked first using a 1/4" pin in the hole to support the depthing tool tip. Each of 
	the labelled shelves was installed and marked with two intersecting arcs using the 
	depthing tool with the appropriate gears affixed. This was started with the top 
	shelf using a long pin cut to be at the same height as the top of the shelf. The pin 
	had a small divot in its center. The pin was shortened for each of the next two 
	shelves. The holes were then punched with the "drop" punch. The five photos below 
	document this process. The fourth photo shows the modification needed for the 
	pin to fit next to the bottom shelf, indicating some changes needed in this shelf.

<p>
	The shelves and base need to be drilled in the marked locations. The plan is to glue 
	the gear axles in place in the base and in the shelves with care taken to ensure they 
	are orthogonal. The shelves need to be modified so they fit not just around the axles, 
	but also around the spacers supporting the gears. The latter was tackled first. A 
	design was sketched on one shelf, cut with the jeweler's saw, transfered to the next, 
	and ecetera. The photo below shows the three modified shelves.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 mod shelves.heic" alt="The shelves decoratively modified to fit around the gear shafts" width="1363" height="1246">

<p>
	The shelves were drilled, first, with a center drill and then with an "A" drill. The 
	holes were reamed to 1/4". The photo below shows the completed, except for sanding, 
	shelves installed on the as yet undrilled base.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 drill shelves.heic" alt="The shelves drilled to fit the gear shafts" width="1418" height="1081">

<p>
	The gear axles can be determined now that the shelves are installed. the long axle 
	supporting all of the driving gears: 67, 47, 39, and 39 teeth, will be fixed to each 
	of the gears and will extend below the bottom frame, where it will be fixed to the 
	orrery base. This produces gear movement when the entire frame is rotated above 
	the base. A decision needs to be made on how best to affix the gears to this shaft, 
	but that will wait as it doesn't affect the shaft length. This shaft will be made 
	3&nbsp;1/4" long. It can be reduced if it doesn't need to extend into the base by 
	1/2". A length of 1/4" drill rod was cut off and both ends faced to length to complete 
	this part.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom shaft supporting the two intermediate gears, 42 and 11, needs to have two 
	different diameters, 1/4" and 1/8", to fit the holes in the two gears. Both of these 
	gears will need to be fixed to one another or to this shaft so they turn as one. The 
	former is preferred as expecting this shaft to rotate smoothly supported only by the 
	frame bottom is challenging at best. The bottom 63 tooth driven gear is held 1/4" 
	above the lower frame, so the 1/4" diameter part of this axle needs to be 1/2" long 
	as it extends into the base. The 1/8" diameter part needs to be 3/16" plus 1/32" or 
	7/32" long. 
</p>

<p>
	The axles attached to the shelves are all the same and need to be 3/16" plus 1/8" 
	plus 1/32" or 11/32". The photo below shows the completed axles.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 axles.heic" alt="The five axles completed" width="1384" height="933">

<p>
	The bottom frame was drilled for the central gear pair and the gears fit nicely. Two 
	of the shelves, top and middle, when installed do not allow the gears to align 
	properly. The through holes in the vertical shelf support were enlarged with a 1/8" 
	end mill, but this was not sufficient to allow all three gears to mesh. Another 
	0.02" is probably needed. After some initial struggles a solution came to mind. Shims 
	will be installed between the support and the shelves. Favoring one side or the other 
	of the shelf will fine tune the mesh of the center gear supported on the shelf with 
	its flanking gears.

	The shimming commenced this morning with the middle shelf. A feeler gauge was used 
	to get a first approximation of how much the shelf needed to be moved outside of each 
	screw, giving 0.017" and 0.041" for the two screws with the latter on the 39 tooth 
	gear side of the shelf. After some consideration the simplest path to shimming 
	appeared to be washers of the appropriate thickness. Two more washers were made with 
	dimensions of 0.025" and 0.051"! My parting skills are very innacurate. The washers 
	were used to offset the shelf, but a previously made washer was used in place of the 
	too large washer. This gave nice movement between the three gears. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 shimmed.heic" alt="The shimmed middle shelf with two washers in place" width="1357" height="1727">

<p>
	I noticed some movement of the two shafts supporting the two larger gears and put 
	the top frame in place to get rid of this wobble. The 39 tooth gear no longer meshed. 
	The 0.04" washer was replaced with the oversized one made above and all gears now 
	move smoothly. The process was repeated with the top shelf and gears. When assembling 
	the entire set of gears the bottom shelf was also found to need some adjustment. 
	After shimming all three gear pairs with idlers the orrery was ready for first 
	assembly. This was done and though a few gears are tight they all turn. The two 
	photos below show the assembled orrery at this stage, a major milestone!

<p class="note">
	The gears on the right in the photos above are not attached to the tubes which will 
	eventually hold them at the correct height. Their edges are resting on the shelves. 
	Assembly is a non-trivial process as a precise order needs to be followed.
</p>

<p>
	Only a week to go in February and progress has been made. Today was spent designing 
	the display side of the orrery. Each of the items represented on the topside will 
	revolve around the earth supported by brass disks. These disks will be separated 
	from one another and the top frame by 1/32" washers. The disks will be 3/16" thick 
	and with the washers will span almost an inch.
</p>

<p>
	The top disk corresponds with the bottom set of gears, requires a 1/8" center hole, 
	will show the moon revolving around the earth, and is surmounted by a pole with the 
	moon on top. The second disk corresponding to the apogee gears, will have a 3/6" center 
	hole, and support a pointer showing the current location of the apogee. (A second 
	pointer could be added to indicate the location of perigee, or closest approach.)  
</p>

<p>
	The third disk down shows the nodes or a tilted ring supported by two posts. The 
	ring's tilt is 5.1&deg;, most easily provided by differences in post length. This 
	disk is connected to the nodes gear train, 39, 18, 37, or third gear set from the 
	bottom. It will be mounted on a 1/4" tube.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom disk will attach to the top gear set with a 5/16" tube. This disk will 
	support the earth, suspended at an angle from a rod that goes up and over everything 
	emanating from the other disks. The earth is suspended at a 66.5&deg; angle. 
	This disk may also support a ring representing the ecliptic plane. Alternatively, 
	this could be supported from the base.
</p>

<p>
	The disks are currently planned to start with 3/16" thick brass plate. With four 
	disks they begin to overwhelm the top plate, chubby baby. If there is a 1/4" diference 
	in radius the disks will range from 1&nbsp;1/2" to 3" in diameter. Dropping that 
	difference to 3/16" drops the disk sizes to 1&nbsp;1/2" to 2&nbsp;1/2". I would like 
	the ball representing earth to be about 3/4" in diameter and the moon to be about 
	3/16" as the latter is similar to the real 1/4 ratio of moon to earth. Thus a 
	1&nbsp;1/2" moon disk leaves a gap of about 1/4" between the two spheres.
</p>

<p>
	The earth at 3/4" diameter will be heavy and will need to be supported by 1/8" brass 
	rod. The rods supporting other markers could be thinner, either 3/32" or 1/16" 
	diameter. The circle marking the nodes will be made from 1/6" brass sheet and 
	no wider than 1/4". There is more flexibility with the possible ecliptic plane as 
	it will sit outside of everything else. The only other feature of the orreries, 
	which have served as models, is the day/night indicator mounted on the top frame. 
	A sketch of these ideas is seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 display.heic" alt="Orrery display sketched out" width="2706" height="1971">

<p>
	The materials were first located. The 3/16" rod, and the three tubes with the 
	following IDs, 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16" were pulled from stock and scrap piles. 3/16" 
	brass was also located for the four disks. An abandoned gear with a 1/4" center hole 
	was used to make the 1&nbsp;7/8" disk. The partially completed gear was mounted on 
	a mandrel and turned to 1.876". The edges were chamfered and the disk sanded to 
	600 grit. The edge and the first 1/2" inch of the two faces were polished with red 
	rouge. The other four disks were treated similarly, though started with square blanks 
	cut from stock. One blank, third from top, could not be sourced from stock and was 
	eventually cut from a material that was composed of two scraps soldered together.

	A two day break was taken on this project to focus on a home repair job. Once again 
	a drawer bracket in the pantry broke. One was made from aluminum as had been done 
	<a href="file:///Users/johnmcdonald/Documents/Metalworking/Notebook/Drawer%20support%20bracket.html">previously</a>, 
	interestingly almost exactly six years ago. The only difference in the project this 
	time was using chain drilling to remove most of the material from the slot that 
	holds the drawer guide rail. Twenty-seven 1/4" holes spaced 0.012-0.015" apart were 
	drilled prior to milling the slot, which went quickly. The milling was done with 
	only vertical movements of the end mill, as if it were a drill. This eliminated the 
	chatter that had dogged most of the milling work on this project. The two photos 
	below show this process.

<p>
	March has sprung and it is back to the orrery. The disks as currently fashioned need 
	a hole for a set screw and need the central hole appropriately sized. The 2&nbsp;1/2" 
	disk was tackled first. It was set on edge in the milling vise and its center located 
	with an edge finder. The hole for the set screw was started with a #0 center drill 
	and then drilled through with #36 drill, tap drill for a 6-32 screw. The hole was 
	opened to 0.144", large enough to clear the tap, for a depth of 3/4". The bottom 1/2" 
	was threaded 6-32. The center hole was opened from 1/4" to 0.375" first with a T drill 
	and then with a 3/8" reamer.
</p>

<p>
	A length of 3/8" OD brass tube was held in the chuck on the lathe. Its actual 
	diameter was 0.3755". The first 3/4" was sanded with 220 grit sandpaper until the 
	disk was a sliding fit in the disk. The height of the disk top to gear bottom was 
	measured on the assembled orrery at 0.751". The tube was parted off at this length. 
	After some deburring the tube and disk were assembled and can be seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="fergOrFrm/FRG2 disk and tube.heic" alt="The 2 1/2 inch disk and tube assembled" width="1344" height="1033">

<p>
	The remaining three disks were drilled and tapped for set screws. The hole of one was 
	opened from 1/4" to 5/16" and the smallest had an insert installed with Loctite, 
	shrinking its center hole from 1/4" to 3/16". The insert had been drilled with the 
	through drill to minimize interference with the set screw. Tubes were made for two 
	of these disks and the smallest disk was fitted with a 3/16" shaft. All are a sliding 
	fit in their mates. The four disks with tubes/rod attached are seen in the photo 
	below.

	The gears are still bothering me as they don't run well even with the adjustments 
	made so far. This morning I spent some time determining what adjustments were 
	needed to help them run more smoothly. With the help of feeler gauges and washers 
	of various thickness the following changes were determined. The bottom shelf's right 
	side spacer should be changed to 0.045". The middle shelf needs a 0.042" spacer on 
	the left and a 0.075" spacer on the right. The top shelf requires a 0.036" spacer 
	on the left and an additional 0.010" added to its current washer on the right. It 
	is also clear that some gear teeth still need work to improve their fit.
</p>

<p>
	The washer thicknesses identified above were prepped and with some difficulty 
	inserted between shelf and shelf support. The bottom and middle gear's trains turn 
	freely, while the top still has some difficulties, which are mitigated somewhat by 
	shifting the shelf a bit to the left. Maybe good enough when the gear teeth are all
	fine tuned.

	The budgie job above has been bugging me for a week, so decided to do something about 
	it. The shelves will be remade and a better way of marking them for the axle holes 
	will be devised. The trick is to find a way to mark them with the top plate in place. 
	This rules out marking with the depthing gauge as it is too large to fit. A similar 
	tool will be constructed that is significantly smaller as shown in the sketch below. 
	The hole on the right will fit the axles of the gears. The slot will hold a sharp 
	point to scratch the new shelves. The point will be held in place by installing a 
	countersunk screw that can expand the point as it has a slot cut through most of its 
	length.

<p>
	The slotted brass part was made first. A 2" length of 3/16" brass was cut from stock. 
	After cleaning up the ends a 1/4" hole was drilled and reamed on center and 1/4" from 
	the end. Two holes were drilled 3/16" at 1/4" and 1" from the opposite end. A 3/16" 
	slot was cut through the brass and between the holes that are 3/16" ID. A 1/4" 
	end mill was then used to widen this slot to a depth of 1/8", leaving a 1/16" shelf.

<p>
	A 1" scrap of 1/4" drill rod was held in the chuck and drilled for a #6 screw about 
	1/4" deep". It was then tapped and deeply countersunk. The part was turned around and 
	held in a collet. The opposite end was reduced to 0.188" and the headstock rotated to 
	30&deg;. The 60&deg; included angle was cut. The part was moved to the vise and the 
	hacksaw was used to cut down through the threaded hole. A screw was shortened to fit.
	It was impossible to hold the scribe in position in the slot while tightening the 
	screw. Back to the drawing board.
</p>

<p>
	A simpler scribe was planned and produced. Another short length of drill rod was found 
	and held in a 1/4" collet. The end was faced and then 3/8" were reduced to 0.188". 
	The end was cut as above to a 60&deg; included angle and sanded to a point. The nice 
	point produced is seen in the first photo below. The reduced end beyond the angle was 
	threaded with a 10-32 die to the shoulder. Parting off at 1/2" produced the scribing 
	point shown below next to the failed slotted version.

<p>
	No 10-32 nuts could be located in my stash, so one was quickly made. A short length 
	of 3/8" hex was held in the chuck and faced. The corners and six edges were chamfered. 
	The hex was drilled about 1/4" deep and then threaded with a tap in the vise. The 
	nut was parted off at about 1/8" and part way through parting the corners of the 
	new side were chamfered with a file. The hole was also chamfered. The three completed 
	parts of this scribing tool are seen below separate and assembled.

<p class="note">
	I do not plan on hardening the scribe. It will only be used on these aluminum shelves, 
	so the current hardness is more than sufficient to mark the aluminum, especially 
	when the aluminum is painted with Dykem.
</p>

<p>
	Three more shelves were made. This round of shelf making was simplified. The three 
	shelves were cut from aluminum with the hacksaw and filed to shape. No decorative 
	edges were made as they can't be seen when assembled. The shelves were held as a unit 
	in the mill vise and the DRO was used to drill, and tap all six 2-56 about 1/4" deep. 
	The photo below shows the latest iteration of the three shelves.

<p>
	The shelves were individually placed on the shelf support. The appropriate gears 
	were depthed and the measurement (outside of the 1/4" axles) transferred to the 
	new scribing tool. The transfer and tightening of the scribe were a little finicky, 
	but all were within a few thou of the depthing tool measurement. The scribe was 
	placed on the appropriate axle followed by the top frame, chubby baby. The scribe 
	was rotated leaving its mark. This process was repeated for the second gear pair at 
	that level, marking the idler gear center. The photo below shows the middle shelf 
	with the scribing tool in place ready for marking.
</p>

<p>
	Transferring to two shelves, middle and top, required a bit of extra care. Both 
	shelves were attached to the shelf support using the holes that had been opened and 
	need to always be installed the same as when marked. The middle shelf was tightened 
	in place and marked when pushed down and right (when looking from the front) better 
	hiding the shelf. The top shelf was pushed the other way, left and down, as its idler 
	gear center is much farther left than the others.
</p>

<p>
	After punching the marked idler gear centers the shelves were held in the vise on 
	parallels, drilled and reamed to 1/4" completing the frame and its many parts. This 
	installment of the Not Quite a Ferguson Orrery will end with three photos of the 
	assembled and gear turning mockup.
