<p class='first'>
	A new marquetry project is on the table, a picture of my one year-old grandson, 
	Freddie. A photo of Freddie in a swing was cut down to just a portrait of his head. 
	After spending some time, not very successfully, to get the picture ready for the 
	laser cutter, a decision was made to do this work the old fashioned way on the scroll 
	saw. 
</p>

<p>
	The picture was printed approximately life size. Areas of differing color were outlined 
	and the different colors numbered 1-23. This is seen in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ initial photo.heic" alt="The picture with differing colors outlined and numbered" width="3990" height="4786">

<p>
	The next step is veneer selection. The box was pulled from the top of the basement 
	upright freezer, where the veneer sheets are stored in a box in a bag with a wet 
	paper towel, my attempt to keep them from drying out. The photo below shows the 
	veneers selected and the table describes their use.

<p class="note">
	<sup>*</sup> The teeth were originally veneer 10, but veneer 1, 2 or 3 will be 
	substituted.
</p>

<p>
	The items listed under "Use" in the table may just be the packets needed to build 
	this picture. The lines dividing the colors were traced onto tracing paper. The 
	work began with color three in the right cheek (left in the picture). Using carbon 
	paper the shape of color 3 was transfered from the tracing paper to the veneer 
	labeled 3. Surrounding lines were transfered as well.
</p>

<p>
	Before proceeding I quickly read through 
	<a href="file:///Marquetry%20notes.html">Marquetry Notes</a> 
	to reinforce a few important details. The scroll saw was already tilted 7&deg; with 
	the left side low. A #2-0 blade was installed. An important consideration is that 
	the top keeper piece stays on the left side of the blade during cutting.
</p>

<p>
	A piece of veneer #2 was cut with the Xacto knife and then taped to the veneer with 
	the sketch using green painter's tape. Using the tracing and carbon paper the design 
	was transferred to this new piece of veneer. Locations and directions for saw blade 
	entry and exit were noted. The one line between the two parts was cut with the scroll. 
	After cutting the new piece that was on top, the keeper, was removed and fit to the 
	bottom piece from the right side of the cut. Veneer tape was wetted and applied to the 
	front face, or show face. This taped cut was allowed to dry under the pressure of the 
	cutting mat for 15 minutes. 
</p>

<p>
	At this point all of the lines were retraced over the veneer tape in preparation for 
	adding the next piece of veneer, also color #2. The same process was repeated and 
	this time documented with the five photos shown below. During drying times a second 
	packet was started, the opposite cheek. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ second taped.heic" alt="The picture redrawn on the two taped veneers" width="1692" height="1756">

<p class="note">
	All of the redrawing of lines is required as these lines are used to align the 
	tracing paper for drawing on the new piece to be added.
</p>

<p>
	The process has been repeated numerous times to prepare more packets. The cheek on 
	the right was completed and work is now progressing on the nose and upper lip packet. 
	Hair will be tackled next. The hair was done in two packets, left and right. Both 
	packets are now complete. All that remains are the eyes and mouth/chin. 
</p>

<p>
	The work is somewhat slow as a fifteen minute waiting period follows each addition of 
	veneer tape, which needs that time to dry. I find the work very relaxing.
</p>

<p>
	Almost November and today began the work on the chin and mouth. Should be 
	straightforward, though the tiny teeth might be a challenge. The lower lip and inside 
	of mouth were cut and taped together. The tongue and lower teeth were put together 
	as a unit and then cut into the mouth. The upper teeth and the upper lip were then 
	added to complete the mouth. The picture below shows the tongue and lower teeth cut 
	into the mouth after a few tiny patches of the darkest wood around the teeth. This is 
	the back side. The second photo below, also of the backside, shows the mouth packet 
	completed. Gotta love the "chicklet" teeth, a Halloween mask on Halloween. As the 
	third photo indicates there is still alot of work to do before this looks like a 
	baby's face, sort of "Picassoesque" at this stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ many packets.heic" alt="The packets completed so far" width="1982" height="1829">

<p>
	The ear packet on the left side of the picture was tackled next. This included hair 
	outside the ear and a bit of the sweatshirt. The sweatshirt followed, beginning with 
	the left, a little more complex, side. The completed packets are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ left shirt.heic" alt="The left side packet of the sweatshirt" width="1992" height="1630">

<p>
	The sweatshirt on the right side of the picture was made this morning, only two 
	pieces. The chin packet was then joined to the two sweatshirt packets. This part of 
	the picture is shown below. With the sweater done as two pieces there is a cut 
	across the veneer below the chin, not the best, but hopefully not too bad looking 
	in the final product.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ bottom.heic" alt="The joined chin and sweater packets" width="1542" height="894">

<p>
	After spending some time pondering how best to make the eyes, some changes were made. 
	The black veneer was supposed to be the iris as the picture is very dark. This 
	seemed like to much, so a dark brown veneer that was to surround the eyes was chosen. 
	This veneer is very heavily figured and readily cracked just upon handling, so it 
	will be softened. The veneer was thoroughly soaked by spraying, and with a rubber 
	glove wiping, the veneer softening liquid from 
	<a href="https://www.veneersupplies.com/">Veneer Supplies</a>. The veneer was wrapped 
	with shop towels and clamped between two boards. At least a day will be required for 
	the veneer to dry, with shop towel replacement every six hours.
</p>

<p>
	A day later and the veneer was dry by feel. Both eyes were done at once, taking 
	advantage of the fifteen minutes needed for the veneer tape to dry. One change was 
	made after studying the picture, the whites of the eyes were switched from a light 
	veneer to the darker veneer used for the sweater, 17. These packets began with the 
	brown iris to which the whites were attached on both ends. Depending on how they 
	look a black pupil may be cut in.
</p>

<p>
	The eyes were quite the challenge and both had to be redone at least once. They were
	both completed this morning, much to my delight. The nose had an additional piece 
	added as I didn't want to add it to the eye on the right. The photo below shows all 
	of the packets somewhat situated in their eventual positions.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ all packets.heic" alt="All of the packets completed and shown in approximate locations" width="2895" height="2781">

<p>
	Assembly began with the two hair packets. These were aligned and taped, cut and 
	taped with veneer tape. The photo below shows the two hair packets taped together. 
	The nose packet was targeted next. First, the rightmost eye was attached and second, 
	the adjacent cheek was cut into place as seen in the second photo below. The third 
	shows the piece after adding the eye and cheek on the left. Getting closer to the 
	big glue-up and reveal!
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ middle face.heic" alt="The nose, both eye and cheek packets all put together" width="2565" height="2195">

<p>
	The ear on the left side was aligned, taped, cut and taped with veneer tape. This 
	leaves only the shirt chin packet combination, the hair packet pair, and the grass 
	background. The three additions to the face will be added in the order listed above. 
	The first two long cuts are both challenging with many tight curves. The background 
	addition requires a long, but simple broad curve cut. The two backgrounds need to be 
	cut together first and that was tackled while the veneer tape dried on the ear 
	addition.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The many sharp turns when cutting the chin/shirt part to the bottom of the nose/cheeks 
	were managed by slowing the speed of the scroll saw dramatically. An accurate cut 
	was the result.
</p>

<p>
	The chin/shirt and middle face were cut together and are shown below in the first 
	photo. The second photo shows the later addition of the hair completing the grandson.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ face and hair.heic" alt="The hair added to the face" width="2988" height="2908">

<p>
	Aligning the background with the overlaid face was a challenge and eventually solved 
	by making crosshatches in corners and using these for alignment. The long line 
	connecting the two was cut from the left side of the picture around the head to the 
	right side where the cut separated the background and the shirt. The photo below 
	shows the completed veneer picture. The second photo is the back side which will be 
	glued to the backer board. Now a backer board needs to be cut after clearing off the 
	tablesaw, which has served as the marquetry workspace. The work also needs more than  
	a dozen small spots filled in as well as pupils. The eyes definitely need pupils.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ back side.heic" alt="The back side of the marquetry piece" width="1829" height="2038">

<p>
	Patches were cut for the holes, some minuscule in size, and glued into the back side. 
	A few holes had ragged edges and were cleaned up before the patches were glued in 
	place. Grain direction was matched with each patch.
</p>

<p>
	Round pupils would be ideal, but cutting round holes and matching round pupils by 
	hand is near impossible. A hole punch will be fashioned from metal and used to cut 
	both. The pupils, not easy to see in the photo, were measured at 1/8", so that is 
	the targeted size for the punch.
</p>

<p>
	A short length of 1/4" drill rod (brass didn't work) was located in the scrap box. 
	One end was faced and then drilled through with a 1/8" drill. The headstock was 
	rotated about 7&deg; and the end was tapered. The photo below shows the punch at 
	this stage. The end was honed, back in the lathe, with coarse and then fine Norton 
	stones.
</p>

<img class=inline src="frmarq/FMQ steel punch.heic" alt="The steel 1/8 inch punch" width="859" height="1318">

<p>
	The punch easily produced round cutouts from the black veneer. The punch was set 
	high in the brown iris and with a few whacks of the brass hammer produced a clean 
	hole. This hole is shown with the adjacent black pupil before gluing. The second 
	photo shows the pupil after adding glue and putting it in place. The other eye was 
	treated similarly. The effect is subtle, but I think worth the minimal effort 
	required.
</p>

<p>
	A sheet of 1/4" birch plywood (Menards, not Baltic) was cut to the size of the frame 
	made a while back for a different project, 8"&nbsp;X&nbsp;11". The marquetry was 
	aligned on this backer board and its overlap marked. The excess veneer was cut off 
	with scissors. Glue was spread over the backer board, the marquetry piece was 
	aligned, and both were placed in the vacuum press on a sheet of wax paper. The press 
	was turned on and the glued panel was pressed for three hours, over 1100 lbs of 
	pressure, seen below. The second photo is fresh off the press. It will be given at 
	least eighteen hours before initiating scraping and sanding.

<p>
	Scraping took about forty-five minutes this morning. Two wooden blocks were clamped 
	to the table saw with the taped piece sitting easily between them. The scraper was 
	used to remove the 90% of the tape, an early morning physical challenge. Sanding with 
	180 grit paper using the oscillating sander removed the remainder. This sanding was 
	followed by sanding with 220 grit paper. The last step prior to applying lacquer was 
	staining the frame. The stain, a mixture of two colors used previously on a table, 
	was wiped on and allowed to dry overnight. This set of steps is documented in the 
	photos below, with the last posing the newly stained frame over the marquetry.

<p>
	The frame dried for four hours. After lightly sanding the frame with 400 grit 
	sandpaper both the frame and the marquetry were moved to the garage and set up for 
	painting. Three thin coats of spray lacquer were applied in two hour intervals. A day 
	was allowed for the lacquer to completely dry. Two 1/16" holes were drilled in the 
	sides of the frame, close to the inside edge. Two tiny washers affixed with #2 wood 
	screws held the washers in place, clamping the picture into the frame. The photo 
	below shows the final framed marquetry.
