<p class="first">
	In three weeks I am taking a class at 
	<a href="https://www.marcadams.com/">Marc Adams School of Woodworking</a>. The course 
	is titled: "Make a Keepsake Child's Sculptural Rocking Chair", taught by Marc. Two 
	days ago the wood was purchased, not my favorite task, as I don't really know what I 
	am doing. Two cherry boards were purchased as well as two hard maple boards.
</p>

<p>
	I can't crosscut long boards with the table saw in my small wood shop, so the boards 
	were laid across 2&nbsp;X&nbsp;4's and cut to length with a circular saw. The garage 
	was over 90&deg;, but the fan helped a little. The saw had no trouble getting through 
	the 8/4 or 1&nbsp;3/4" thick wood as long as the board was held tightly under my foot. 
	A framing square was used as a saw guide and clamped to the board with three large 
	pinch clamps.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC cutting.heic" alt="The boards being cut to length in the garage" width="2863" height="2261">
<img class=inline src="images/SRC to length.heic" alt="The boards after cutting to length" width="2535" height="2460">

<p>
	Today the boards were ripped to width on the table saw. A seldom used blade was 
	employed as it was sharper than the blade usually in the saw. The table saw had little 
	trouble getting through the thick material, unless it approached a knot in the maple. 
	Two cuts were made on opposite sides so both sides were clean when the desired width 
	was reached. All boards were ripped except two that were already near the appropriate 
	width.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Now it is off to Menards. Some tools needed for the class, a Japanese saw rasp, 8-14 
	gouge, 5/8" brad point drill bit, etcetera were purchased online. An angle grinder 
	is also needed, one equipped with a sanding attachment and coarse sandpaper. A Bosch 
	angle grinder was selected along with a sanding pad and a few grits of sandpaper to 
	fit.
</p>

<p>
	The morning was again spent in the garage, though this time the focus was on the 
	lathe. The tool list for the class includes dowel centers in 1/2" and 5/8" sizes. 
	The former were available from Rockler where a few other required tools were also 
	purchased. I decided to make the 5/8" size.
</p>

<p>
	A 5" length of 3/4" steel hex was cut on the horizontal bandsaw. This was held in the 
	three jaw chuck, faced, and the end turned down to 0.620" for 5/8". The corner was 
	chamfered with a file. The steel was removed from the chuck and was cut off with a 
	hacksaw 7/16" from the reduced portion. This process was repeated three more times 
	making the parts shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC reduced end.heic" alt="The length of steel with one end faced and reduced" width="1700" height="1664">

<p>
	The part was returned to the lathe, but this time the reduced end was held in a 
	collet, ensuring the eventual machined point is concentric with the machined end. 
	After facing the end, such that 3/8" of hex remained. The final 0.25" was then 
	reduced to 0.30". The compound slide was set at 30&deg; and the central stub was 
	reduced to a point. This work, nearly complete, is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC point.heic" alt="The opposite end reduced to a point" width="1291" height="1460">

<p>
	The other three parts were machined in the same fashion to produce the four dowel 
	centers shown below. The final operation was sanding the six faces remaining from 
	the original hexagonal stock. This was done with 120 grit sandpaper producing the 
	four completed dowel centers seen in the second photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC sanded.heic" alt="The dowel centers after sanding the original faces" width="1613" height="1592">

<p class="note">
	A decision was made at this point not to harden the points. They will be used to 
	transfer hole locations to wood and should be sufficiently hard to manage this task.
</p>

<p>
	Something was needed to hold the dowel centers, so a "not quite a box" was fashioned. 
	A 2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;3" block of wood was located. The block was 
	cut in two on the table saw to produce a bottom and a lid. The bottom was marked for 
	four holes and drilled with a 5/8" brad point drill bit to a little over 5/8" deep. 
	The dowel centers were put in the four holes and the lid aligned over the points. The 
	lid was given a few raps with a hammer to transfer the holes. The lid was drilled 
	with a 7/8" Forstner bit and then the bottom was opened with a countersink for the 
	points. After sanding the holes in the top to open them up, the lid fit nicely on the 
	block of dowel centers. The sides were sanded and the corners chamfered producing the 
	block shown below, which does a nice job of protecting me from the points.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC block.heic" alt="A block to hold the dowel centers" width="1969" height="2286">

<p>
	The workshop is now over, though the chair is far from finished. The workshop was a 
	whirlwind as is to be expected, when Marc Adams is the instructor. At the end of the 
	class he informed us that this was in the top ten of project complexity of the four 
	thousand workshops taught at MASW over the years! The whirlwind of a workshop was 
	complicated by a whirlwind in my bowels that left me sidelined for over half of a 
	day and moving slowly the remainder. Luckily, the class was supported by three 
	outstanding assistants, who kept me somewhat on track. This was the first time the 
	class was taught and the next time the five day class will be extended to a 
	sixth day to spend more time on sculpting. An incredible workshop!!
</p>

<p>
	Much of the afternoon will be spent returning tools to their homes, finding places 
	to store the cutoffs, and bringing in the partially completed chair for further work.
	Marc informed us that at least forty more hours of work would be required to complete 
	the chair. Much of this time will be spent sculpting each of the parts and then once 
	glued, sculpting the joints. Of course this is followed by hand sanding and finish 
	application.
</p>

<p class="note">
	Only one thing about this class troubled me, the purchased grinder. As it turns out 
	I purchased the wrong grinder, a 4" not 4.5" grinder is needed. The smaller grinder 
	from Makita has a 5/16" spindle instead of the common 5/8" spindle and fits a small 
	rubber disk and small sanding pads. Mine is much too large to get into the smaller 
	areas needing sculpting. I might cheat and make an adapter to reduce my 5/8" spindle 
	to the 5/16" spindle needed for using the smaller fittings shown in the photo below, 
	though working with a heavier grinder also presents challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Before going further into the details of sculpting the roughly cut chair shown below
	the work in class will be recounted from my not so voluminous notes. The photo below 
	shows the chair upon first setting it on the rockers with dowels in place. The arms 
	were rough cut at the time, but were not installed during rocker attachment. The chair 
	at this stage has not seen any glue and can be readily disassembled.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC assembled.heic" alt="The chair mostly assembled at the conclusion of the workshop" width="2114" height="2472">

<p>
	The chair was designed on 1/8" MDF at full size. The dominant face, in this case the 
	side, was drawn on the board. The rocker is designed so the seat is 12" high based 
	on measurements of children published years ago by MIT. Adult sculptural rockers are 
	designed to fit an individual, who can sit in the rocker, allowing adjustments. This 
	is necessary for achieving the most comfort. Does the seat fit the person's bottom? 
	Does the curve in the spindles fit the curve of the sitter's back? For this chair 
	we went with the design Marc used in making multiple such chairs for his children 
	and grandchildren. Only the final design sketch is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC design.heic" alt="The chair design from the dominant view" width="2857" height="3380">

<p>
	The seat was the first part tackled. Two templates were made using 1/8" MDF, again 
	based off of Marc's. One template defined the outside and the extent of the flat part 
	of the seat. The second template defined the front edge of the seat. These two 
	templates are shown on the design in the first photo. The seat made from three 
	cherry boards, jointed but not glued, with the design drawn out is shown in the 
	second photo. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC seat sketched.heic" alt="The seat with the design marked out" width="2723" height="2107">

<p>
	A bandsaw was used to cut out some of the center of the seat as seen in the first 
	photo below. It was at this stage that the three boards were glued. The three board 
	glue-up was made square on the tablesaw, very important because all of the joints 
	need to be parallel or perpendicular to one another. The two photos below show the 
	process of chiseling out the seat.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC seat chiseling 2.heic" alt="Using a chisel to remove waste from the seat" width="2287" height="1856">

<p>
	Something that should have been done in class was chiseling out the shape of the 
	seat front, both the top and the bottom. This was the first job to tackle after 
	moving the chair to the basement workshop and cleaning off the workbench. The chair 
	bottom is shown below with the top area along the front that needs to be removed.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC seat front 1.heic" alt="The seat marked for the area on the top of the front that needs to be removed" width="3899" height="2101">

<p>
	It is now a week since the class ended and time to begin the sculpting process. This 
	began with chiseling the top front edge to match the drawn lines. The seat was flipped 
	over and the bottom was marked and chiseled, though this will be redone as 
	insufficient material was removed. The photo below shows the seat from the top after 
	completing this first round.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC chiseled front.heic" alt="The seat after chiseling between the lines" width="3553" height="2085">

<p>
	The seat bottom where significant material had been removed creating the tush 
	depression, was lumpy in places. These lumps were removed with the rasp and created 
	a well shaped and smooth to the touch posterior impression as seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rasped btm.heic" alt="The seat after rasping out the bottom" width="3466" height="3123">

<p>
	The rasp leaves long grooves that need to be removed. This was done with 50 grit 
	sandpaper. The sandpaper was held by hand and after many strokes removed the rasp's 
	cutting marks.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rasp sanding.heic" alt="The seat after sanding away the rasping cuts" width="3013" height="2330">

<p>
	What I didn't notice until the rasping and sanding dust was removed with a vacuum 
	were the marks left by the end of the rasp as it dug into the curve at the back. 
	These are readily apparent in the photo above. Removing these by hand was not very 
	effective as they are so deep. An alternative was stumbled upon by the drill press, 
	where a bunch of extra accessories are piled. A 3M rubber sanding pad and a 40 grit 
	glue back sanding disk. The pair made quick work of the gouges when the disk was 
	mounted in the cordless drill. Care had to be taken to not leave sanding grooves in 
	the back of the curve.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC disk sanding.heic" alt="The seat after sanding away the rasping gouges with disk mounted sandpaper" width="2375" height="1798">

<p>
	At this point the seat bottom depression is completed except for final sanding. The 
	front edge, however, still needs significant work. This was accomplished in the 
	afternoon on both the bottom and top using the chisel to sculpt the edge to the 
	desired shape. A small amount of edge was left to complete the roundover with 
	sandpaper.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC edge chisel.heic" alt="The front edge of the seat after chiseling it to the desired profile" width="3442" height="2376">

<p>
	An attempt to remove the chisel marks on the front edge with the newly created disk 
	sander was begun, but the drill suddenly stopped working. Assuming it was the 
	battery, the battery was removed and placed in the charger. The battery was recharged 
	in about 15 minutes, but the drill still does not function!! The rasp was turned to 
	and of course works well, but leaves rasp marks. The nice thing about using the rasp 
	is that the profile can be sculpted and this was done creating nice smooth curves. 
	Sanding by hand with 50 grit paper required about fifteen minutes to remove the rasp 
	marks from half of one side of the front edge. The first photo shows the results of 
	sanding with the now defunct disk sander, the second shows the results after rasping 
	and the third shows the sanding progress to remove the rasp marks.

<p>
	Gluing up a repair on the seat corner that busted out yesterday began the day. 
	A scrap of cherry was located and one square corner was cut off. The chipout was not 
	square, but was squared up with saw and chisel. Glue was applied and the clamped 
	corner repair is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC repair.heic" alt="A scrap of cherry glued into the broken corner of the seat" width="2036" height="2645">

<p>
	The arm supports were studied and sketches drawn on them from two directions of their 
	approximate final shape. This allowed determination of just how much material could 
	be removed, about 2&nbsp;5/8". This excess was removed with the table saw. Since the 
	arm supports span two joints, it was not clear what sculpting could be accomplished 
	without attaching the seat and/or the arms. Focus shifted to the rockers as most of 
	these are not near joints.
</p>

<p>
	The rockers are too wide and too tall or thick. The center of the bottom curves of 
	the rockers are fixed and not to be messed with. The bottoms were prepared by taping the 
	two rockers together side-by-side and sanding the bottoms on a spindle sander. The 
	work was done by one of the helpers during the time I was out. Prior to this work I 
	had cut the rockers to profile with the band saw, after the two flats for the leg 
	joints were cut parallel and flat with a table saw. The spindle sander left a very 
	smooth and flat surface on the middle bottom of the rockers. The outer parts of the 
	rockers can be sculpted on the bottom (though probably won't be), but not the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The picture after the next paragraph illustrates an important point about rocking 
	chairs in general. Most of the weight of the rocker and the person rocking sits over 
	a point below the back leg. For a child's rocker this is not so important as the 
	child, who fits this chair, won't weigh all that much. For an adult chair this is 
	important. Most of the weight of the adult will be held up by the two joints holding 
	the back legs to the seat. Consequently, the beefy hip joints used in this rocker. 
	There is no stronger common woodworking joint.
</p>

<p>
	The female hip joints for this rocker were cut first with a dado blade in a table 
	saw followed by routing above and below to produce the half-round profile. The 
	male halves of the joint were also cut with a dado blade and then routed to their 
	half-round shape with a profile bit. Tight joints were managed by sneaking up on the 
	depth of the routed cuts on the female joints in the seat.
</p>

<p>
	Lines were drawn on the rockers to indicate the approximate shape and desired width 
	and height. Placing the doweled front and back legs on the rockers did not indicate 
	any modifications were needed in the locations of the these lines. The lines can be
	seen upon expanding the photo below. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rocker lines.heic" alt="Lines on the rockers indicating approximate desired final size" width="3969" height="2374">

<p>
	I must admit to some hesitation to begin sculpting other parts of the chair. 
	Overcoming my trepidation a rocker was started. The middle part between the leg 
	joints was targeted first. The rocker was reduced in thickness from both sides with 
	the Japanese saw rasp. About 3/16" was removed from both sides. About 3/8" was removed 
	from the top of the rocker. This left a rectilinear shape, but now ready for shaping 
	into the desired semi-round cross section. The photos below attempt to show this 
	process. This one section of one rocker took about 45 minutes of physical labor.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rocker profile.heic" alt="Top side of rocker reduced with the saw rasp" width="2674" height="2056">

<p>
	The second rocker was treated similarly reducing the central portion, also requiring 
	forty-five minutes of hard work. Good exercise and in a relatively cool basement.
</p>

<p>
	The front and back of the first rocker were thinned next. This rocker thinned 
	everywhere except the areas close to joints is shown in the photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rocker thinned.heic" alt="The rocker thinned with the saw rasp" width="1771" height="3720">

<p>
	The rasping was exhausting me so an alternate path was sought. The scroll saw seemed 
	ideal as I don't have a bandsaw. A number of blades were tried before settling on a 
	#9 blade. Cross cuts were made about every inch to provide some relief from the 
	cutting, which was challenging. The rocker had to be held tightly to the bed while 
	proceeding slowly with the cutting. Got some bad burning early on, but less after 
	lowering the speed of the blade. In total about three hours was required to complete 
	the rough cutting on both rockers, which are shown below next to a photo depicting 
	early struggles with burning the cherry.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rockers rough.heic" alt="The rockers roughed to dimension with rasp and scroll saw" width="3326" height="2983">

<p>
	Not sure where to go next in terms of sculpting, so took a sculpting break and spent 
	three hours hand sanding the seat with 120 grit sandpaper. A few of the worst rasping 
	marks were removed with a half round file, if they were on a convex surface or if 
	on an accessible concave surface. The resulting seat looks very good upon close 
	inspection and is pictured below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC seat 120.heic" alt="The seat sanded to remove all rasp marks with 120 grit sandpaper" width="3627" height="2684">

<p>
	As far as next steps for sculpting goes some areas of the back legs can be reduced in 
	size similar to the work on the rockers. Most of the remainder of the parts have 
	minimal area between joints and the joints aren't touched until assembled. My plan 
	currently is to assemble the chair and clamp it tight as if it were being glued up. 
	The joints will be marked for rough cutting. The chair can then be disassembled and 
	the rest of the parts roughly cut. Final rasping to shape will be done after the 
	chair has been glued up. A few more bar clamps are needed to tackle this next step.
</p>

<p>
	The rockers can be sculpted to final shape distant from the joints, so this was 
	begun next. The back parts just need to be rounded, but still with a flat bottom most 
	of the way. The top was tackled first with the saw rasp. After some work it was not 
	clear exactly what I was shooting for so a template was made from a scrap of 1/4" 
	thick pine. A hole was cut in the pine with a 1&nbsp;3/8" Forstner bit and opened to 
	the end with a saw. The first photo below shows the beginning of the work and the 
	second shows the pretty much completed roundover with the template.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rocker template.heic" alt="The back of a rocker rasped to a consistent roundover" width="2515" height="2089">

<p>
	After a few days with no ability to get into the shop I am back to sculpting. The 
	back of the second leg was sculpted, again with the saw rasp. The middles of the 
	two rockers were then tackled. These are too wide for the template so were completed 
	by eye. They were also partly rasped with the Nicholson rasp as it can better get into 
	the curves where the legs join. The two rockers at this stage of sculpting are shown 
	below. Not quite sure how to round the ends, so these have been left untouched.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rocker sculpting.heic" alt="The rockers sculpted on the ends and in the middle" width="2920" height="2942">

<p>
	The remainder of the sculpting requires an assembled chair. The chair was clamped 
	together with seven clamps plus two for one arm. My clamp selection is one shy of 
	being able to clamp both arms. The clamped chair is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC clamped 1.heic" alt="The chair clamped up so the desired sculpting lines can be drawn" width="2384" height="2991">
<img class=inline src="images/SRC clamped 2.heic" alt="The chair clamped up so the desired sculpting lines can be drawn" width="2340" height="2737">

<p>
	The desired curves were marked out with a pencil beginning with the front legs. The 
	back legs were also sketched in as well as the one clamped arm. Photos of Marc's 
	chair were used as a reference, though actual dimensions were just approximated. The 
	curves drawn were adjusted until they looked good to my eye. The curves are close to 
	final dimension so any rough sculpting needs to end about 1/4" outside the lines. 
	Final sculpting will be completed once the chair has been glued up. The three photos 
	below show the front leg lines from three sides. The second arm was then clamped and

	The holes for the arms and their supports are not aligned correctly. Dowels were 
	made from maple scraps with a scraper. These dowels were pounded into the holes
	until they reached bottom after adding glue. The photo below shows the dowels in 
	place.
</p>

<p>
	The next morning the dowels were cut off with the flush cutting saw. The arm supports 
	needed the holes from the arms transfered, but there was no 3/8" dowel center as the 
	original 5/8" and 1/2" dowels were substituted with 1/2" and 3/8". A quick trip to 
	the small lathe and the 3/8" dowel center was made from scrap steel hex. This center 
	is shown below. After marking the new hole locations in the arm supports they were 
	drilled with a 3/8" Forstner drill bit about 3/4" deep.
</p>

<p>
	The next step is roughly rasping all of the parts except the seat. To this end all 
	of the parts was again marked, though this time with a Sharpie and about 1/8" outside 
	the previous pencil markings. The last 1/8" will be taken care of once the parts are 
	assembled and they can be appropriately mated. Using a combination of saw, saw rasp, 
	and Nicholson rasp the two arm supports were roughly rasped to the Sharpie lines. 
	The two supports are seen below.

<p class="note">
	Sawing and rasping this hard maple is physically challenging work!
</p>

<p>
	A front leg was tackled next. It and the arms point out a flaw in my marking. Once a 
	side is roughly rasped to shape the marks for its two adjacent sides vanish. Photos 
	and extending the marks over the ends will be used to remind me of these marks' 
	locations. The first photo below shows the front leg set up for sawing off a large 
	section of the top. The completely roughed leg is also shown below. The other front 
	leg was roughed out similarly.

<p>
	After a day in Cincinnatti to visit the future recipient of the chair it is back to 
	work. A number of tasks remain before it is time for glueup. The spindles need to be 
	reduced along their length to fit more deeply in the mating holes in seat and chair 
	back. The back legs need to be reduced in width to align with the outside of the seat. 
	The rockers, where they join legs, need some major reduction. The front corners of the 
	seat need to be sculpted. The crest rail needs to be shaped and the ends of the rockers 
	should to be rounded. Much of the rockers can be sanded up to 150 grit or so. Some 
	work on the spindles can be done before assembly especially sculpting the side-to-side 
	shape. The design to be carved in the crest rail can be done before gluing. Finally, 
	the arms can stand some rough shaping.
</p>

<p>
	Spindles were sculpted first. The ends were reduced as needed to fit all the way to 
	the bottoms of the holes in the seat and crest rail. The tops need a pronounced 
	radius, while the bottoms sport a gradual slope. The work was begun on each spindle 
	with the saw rasp and finished with the Nicholson rasp. The four sculpted spindles 
	are shown below. Where to go from here on the spindles still confuses me, but will 
	be mapped out with them in place between seat and chair back.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC shaped spindle.heic" alt="The spindles rasped to the appropriate shape from side to side" width="2143" height="3931">

<p>
	To add further confusion to the mix the seat, crest rail and back legs were put 
	together. By accident the crest rail was put in backwards. This almost eliminated 
	the issue of the outside spindles sitting significantly higher than the inside 
	spindles. With the spindles fully inserted a bit of the groove cut for the biscuit 
	is visible, but less with the crest rail in backwards. The only issue with putting 
	the crest rail in backwards is there is more tension when aligning the biscuits 
	during assembly. The first photo shows the crest rail inserted normally with the 
	biscuit slot just visible. The second shows the crest rail in backwards.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC cr backwards.heic" alt="The spindles, crest rail, seat, and legs assembled with a backwards crest rail" width="3337" height="2898">

<p>
	Decided to go with the backwards crest rail! One of the spindles needed about 1/4" 
	of material removed from the front face to be even with the other three. All needed 
	significant material removed from the back faces as I am planning to thin them to about 
	5/8". To this end the front of the first spindle was rasped bringing it down to the 
	level of the others. Spindles two and three were then thinned from the back. About 
	1/2" of material had to be removed in the middle and feathered out to about two inches 
	from the ends. A chisel was used to remove most of the material, followed by the saw 
	rasp and then the Nicholson. Both spindles were then cleaned up with a file, much 
	more efficient than coarse sandpaper. The first photo shows a spindle after the chisel 
	next to a second spindle marked for the same work. The second shows a rasped spindle 
	and the third a filed spindle.

<p class="note">
	Each spindle required about 1&nbsp;1/2 hours of work to get to the stage shown above. 
	Hard physical labor, but rewarding when viewing the completed work.
</p>

<p>
	Ran a four hour rocker marathon this morning. All of the places where legs attach were 
	shaped to size, including the curves in front and back of each of the four joints, as 
	well as the sides. My work with the saw rasp is improving with each use. The photo 
	below shows the completely shaped rockers.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rockers shaped.heic" alt="The rockers after rasping and shaping" width="2927" height="1524">

<p>
	After the rockers come the legs. The smaller front legs were first shaped after 
	careful marking. The photo below shows the resulting legs.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC front legs shaped.heic" alt="The front legs after rasping and shaping" width="1863" height="1793">

<p>
	The back legs have me stumped. A lot of material, ~1/2", needs to be removed from 
	almost the entire length of each leg. A bandsaw would be ideal, but I don't own one, 
	at least not a vertical bandsaw. Sawing by hand would be a nightmare, keeping to a 
	line over two feet of hard maple. Two alternate possibilities come to mind. The angle 
	grinder might work as it can remove a lot of material quickly. Another possibility is 
	using a router in a jig, allowing the router to move back and forth across the length 
	of the leg. The angle grinder is the quickest to attempt, so that will be tried first.
</p>

<p>
	Not as quick as planned, testing the angle grinder approach. First, the Bosch angle 
	grinder purchased a month ago was discovered to have the very nice X-lock system. 
	Unfortunately, I was unaware of this when I purchased the device. After determining 
	that the X-lock system cannot be effectively removed or used on regular accessories, 
	it was back to Menards to purchase two flap sanding discs, 60 and 120 grit. A leg was 
	clamped to the downdraft table with vacuum attached. I wore a dust mask, safety 
	glasses and hearing protection. A full body suit would have been helpful.
</p>

<p>
	The angle grinder made quick work of removing the material and with no burning or 
	digging in. The disc was kept at a 10-15&deg; angle, while constantly moving from 
	side to side. One leg about half complete is seen below. The amount of dust produced 
	was gargantuan! Not only a huge quantity, but spread across the entire shop. 
	Vacuuming up the dust took more time than sanding the legs. In any event both are 
	now thinned to a more reasonable size as seen in the second photo below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC back legs thinned.heic" alt="The back legs after sanding to a thinner profile" width="3272" height="1793">

<p>
	The bottom two or three inches was not completed with the angle grinder as it is 
	tapered. This was finished with the rasps. The rasps were also used to smooth out 
	the waviness left by the grinder's sanding. With the legs thinned the two perpendicular 
	faces were tackled. Some lines were scribed when holding the back legs on dowels in 
	the rockers. These lines were extended to produce the desired curves. This can be 
	seen in the first photo below. The second photo shows the bottom of one back leg 
	after rasping to the lines.

<p>
	After many hours of rasping one back leg is completed, i.e. sculpted to rough shape. 
	The side originally cut with the band saw was also gone over with the rasp to remove 
	a few small hills and valleys. Tomorrow will see the second back leg sculpted to the 
	same shape, realizing less than one month remains before the birthday party.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC bleg roughed.heic" alt="A back leg after rasping all four sides" width="1582" height="3788">

<p>
	The following morning the second back leg was completed to the same stage of 
	sculpting. The rasping marks were removed with a file. The arms and the crest rail
	are the remaining parts that require some sculpting before assembly. The crest rail 
	also needs to be decorated prior to assembly. I am considering a veneer inlay, but 
	have not settled on a design.
</p>

<p>
	A second aspect of finishing the chair is the finish. Marc never uses stain. He 
	starts with boiled linseed oil, with initiator added, to saturate (more on end grain), 
	then wipes it off after an hour and buffs. The linseed oil needs to dry for a week! 
	So much for completing this by the birthday party. Deft semi-gloss lacquer is sprayed 
	on after warming the cans in 120&deg; water. The chair is sanded lightly after the 
	first coat of a total of three. As a finishing touch Marc recommends finishing the 
	finish: 0000 steel wool to remove any shine, followed by paste wax and buffing.
</p>

<p>
	I want to at least explore some stain possibilities along side just the lacquer. To 
	that end two cutoffs were prepared, one cherry and one maple. They were planed and 
	then sanded from 80 to 320 grit leaving a glass-like feel. A number of stains will 
	be applied to patches on both boards. Both boards will then be coated with linseed 
	oil and lacquer. Boiled linseed oil is available at Menards and has the requisite 
	additives to speed drying. New cans of lacquer also need to be purchased and Menards 
	does not carry semi-gloss spray cans. Rockler carries the desired lacquer but not in 
	the store. Woodcraft carries both Watco lacquer and the linseed oil in store.
</p>

<p>
	A number of tasks were completed this morning, August 17. The arms were sculpted to 
	approximate shape, mostly rounding below the circular ends. With the arms shaped they 
	were returned to the clamped up arm supports, which were marked. The arm supports were 
	removed and shaped as needed to fit the arms. This work is documented in the three 
	photos below.
</p>

<p>
	A decision was made to leave the crest rail flat on both the back and front, at least 
	not with a pronounced convex or concave shape from side to side. Wide chamfers were 
	shaped on the front, both top and bottom. The top corners were shaped to better fit 
	the curve of the back legs. A concave carve-out was made on both sides of the back to 
	fit the back leg's curve. The two photos below show the front and back of the crest 
	rail.

<p>
	It is no longer clear what else needs to be done. The chair was clamped together 
	revealing a number of areas for more sculpting. Two photos below show the chair 
	clamped together <em>sans</em> rockers.
</p>

<p>
	When doweled to the rockers, it was readily apparent that some work could be done on 
	the junctures between legs and rockers as seen in the two photos below.
</p>

<p>
	The other two areas that still need work are the spindles, the two on the right side 
	need to be shortened by 1/4" to lower the crest rail and hide the lower end of the 
	biscuit joint. The arm supports require significant shaping/material removal. The 
	exposed biscuit joint cut is seen in the first photo below. The second photo shows 
	the excess wood on an arm support.

	A good part of this excess was removed with saws. The photo below shows the arm 
	supports after sawing off the material at a compound angle with multiple saws.

	Work on the arm supports continued somewhat haphazardly until a final shape was 
	settled on. The first arm support was sculpted as shown below, though a break was 
	needed before beginning the second.

	set in place on the chair and are shown below. I am pleased with their shape.

	The two photos below show how the back legs currently mate to the rockers. Both legs 
	are slightly twisted. The front legs are similar, but not twisted quite so much. The 
	bottoms of the legs, front and back, and the leg mating surfaces on the rockers were 
	marked to facilitate removal of the excess material with a rasp. The back legs should 
	have a semicircular cross section on the front and back while the sides are kept flat 
	from top to bottom. The front legs should have a completely round profile in the  
	center, but with flats on the sides as they join the rockers and the seat. The inside 
	of the seat join will be round.

	Most of the day was spent working on the rockers. The excess material was removed.
	Corners were rounded and the ends were shaped. Even the bottoms had some bumps that 
	had to be removed. The two photos below show the current state of the rockers.

	The sanded scraps from multiple paragraphs above were tackled today. I liked the 
	looks of just the boiled linseed oil so much that no stains were explored. The photo 
	below shows the boiled linseed oil on the scraps, though the photo does not adequately 
	reflect the looks of the two pieces of wood.

	Took a short break from the work, unintentionally. Felt like a bad cold was coming on 
	Tuesday and felt really bad Wednesday. A combination Covid-19, Flu A, Flu B test 
	clearly indicated a Covid-19 infection, my first. No symptoms in my lungs only a very 
	congested head, fever and headache. Started on Paxlovid, extremely expensive even for 
	an old pharmaceutical researcher, and began feeling better in twelve hours. Today, 
	Saturday, August 23, it is back to sculpting. Today is leg sculpting!

<p>
	The bottom corners had already been marked when sitting on the rockers, so these 
	were quickly taken care of with only a small amount of material removed. Lines 
	were drawn on all four faces of the leg to serve as targets as the corners were 
	rounded. A 45&deg; chamfer was first put on a corner with the saw rasp. This was 
	rounded with the Nicholson rasp and the round corner finished with the half-round 
	file. Flats were left on the bottom four sides to eventually mate with the 
	corresponding flats at the rocker mounting locations.
</p>

<p>
	The back legs were worked on over three days, not because they took that long, but 
	because of lack of a vision of the final product. In any event most of the long edges 
	that needed to be rounded, a little or a lot, were in fact completed. The two 
	sculpted legs are seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rounded back legs.heic" alt="The two rounded back legs" width="3058" height="2285">

<p>
	With legs mostly completed the arms were targeted. First, lines were sketched on the 
	arms to indicate where the rounding should end. A depression was chiseled and sanded 
	into the large flat area. The edges all around were rasped and filed to shape. The 
	first two pictures below show the lines drawn for rasping limits and the depression. 
	The last three photos show the completed arms from multiple perspectives.

	Two items need to be completed prior to assembly. The bottom front edge of the seat 
	needs to be sculpted on the two corners. The crest rail needs to be decorated. There 
	may be others that I am missing. In order to seek any other pre-assembly chores the 
	chair was dry assembled.
</p>

<p>
	The crest rail sits proud in front as seen in the photo below. It is also a little 
	high revealing a bit of the biscuit joint on the right side. This latter issue was 
	quickly resolved by shortening the two spindles on the right side by about 1/8". 
	Sitting proud will be taken care of during the assembled sculpting.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC cr proud.heic" alt="The crest rail sits high above the back legs" width="1826" height="2210">

<p>
	The only major issue uncovered is the junction between arms and back legs. In both 
	cases the joint does not come together as shown below. The gap is about 1/16" or so. 
	There is insufficient flex in the leg supports when attached to the seat to provide 
	any relief. The only path forward is to prepare slices of cherry or maple to slide 
	into the gaps. My fear is that this will highlight the problem with two glue joints 
	so close together. On closer inspection it might and was possible to pull these joints 
	together with clamps.

<p>
	A decision was reached and the image on the crest rail will be a cartoon cat inlay 
	of brass, copper and aluminum. 1/16" thick brass and aluminum sheets are in my stock. 
	The copper is only 1/32", but as it is used on only three small areas, the surrounding 
	metal can be chamfered to fit. In order to provide more "colors", some engraving will 
	also be done on the metal in certain areas. Engraving and saw kerfs will be used to 
	simulate lines in the cartoon. The cartoon is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC cartoon.png" alt="The crest rail sits high above the back legs" width="1130" height="1110">

<p>
	The cartoon was scaled to 32% making it about 4&nbsp;1/2"&nbsp;X&nbsp;4&nbsp;1/2". 
	The paws will be aluminum along with the face and whites of the eyes. The inside of 
	the ears, the mouth and the nose will be copper. The rest of the cat will be brass. 
	The current plan is to "draw" the stripes onto the brass using a pointing tool with 
	hundreds of small dots. The black in the eyes may just be painted onto the aluminum. 
	The shadowed area on the left side and bottom of the cat may be ignored.
</p>

<p>
	The first step is printing out the cat and transferring the design to the metal. This 
	was done by smearing China white onto the brass, taping the design on, and slipping a 
	sheet of carbon paper under the design. The cat was transfered with a pencil sketching 
	all of the lines. A photo of the traced cat is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC transfer.heic" alt="The crest rail sits high above the back legs" width="2238" height="1470">

<p>
	The sawing began. A jeweler's saw was used to cut out the cat. The back leg was cut 
	separately, just to emphasize the break between the body and the back leg. The first 
	few cuts are seen below. One challenge is the size of the brass blank relative to 
	the saw. A larger saw would be nice to minimize stopping cuts and starting from 
	the opposite ends, when the corner of the blank won't fit through the too narrow saw.

<p>
	The cartoon cat sawing was completed this morning. The paws were cut from aluminum 
	and the face also. The holes in the ears and in the face were traced onto the copper 
	and the cutting was done outside the lines. A bit of filing and the pieces fit 
	reasonably well. The copper is thinner than the aluminum and brass, so the edges of 
	the holes will be beveled. Some of this was done just to get a feel for the look. 
	The first photo below shows the nose and tongue in place, the second shows the 
	complete cat at this stage.

<p>
	Prior to proceeding an experiment was run. A scrap of brass had a bit of cat sketched 
	on a clean face. This included areas simulating the stripes and shadows on the 
	cat, three textures are needed. The stripes were filled in with the pointing graver. 
	A few lines were cut with a 120&deg; graver. The brass was sanded with 400 and then 
	600 grit sandpaper. The brass was then polished with a buffing wheel and red rouge. 
	Finally, an area, the shadowed part of the fur was sanded with 600 grit sandpaper. 
	The result is shown below. I like the three textures, though the sanding will need 
	to be done with an automated tool for more control and to minimize the straight lines.

<p>
	All of the small bits of engraving were completed quickly. More time consuming was 
	pointing the many stripes. This is shown in the first photo below. Most of the cat 
	pieces were then sanded, 600 for the aluminum and 400/600 for the brass. These sanded 
	parts were polished on the buffing wheel with white or red rouge. The polished parts 
	are shown in the second photo.

<p>
	The remaining parts were polished this morning using the Dremel, while holding the 
	part with pliers wrapped in a paper towel. Not ideal for holding, but the polishing 
	was quick on the tiny parts. The three photos below attempt to capture the polished 
	whole, though I have yet to figure out how to adequately photograph polished things.

<p>
	Inlaying the cat into the crest rail is the next step, but requires some thought 
	prior to implementation. I hope to minimize the amount of resanding and repolishing 
	needed for the cat. Polishing is impossible once the metal is set in the wood. The 
	cat will be taped together and the tape overhang trimmed off. The assembled cat will 
	then be traced on the crest rail that has already been sanded to 320 in the area 
	around the cat's location.
</p>

<p>
	After taping the cat together it was traced onto the crest rail. A 1/8" router bit 
	was used to rough out the bulk of the material to a depth just shy of 1/16". This is 
	shown in the first photo below. Material was removed to the line, but leaving the 
	line, with a 1/16" end mill. Once the ears fit adjustments were made elsewhere until 
	the cat dropped down into the routed area. The taped cat inlaid is seen in the second 
	photo. The third photo shows the cat and tail inlaid into the crest rail.

<p>
	The cat was removed and the area around the depression was sanded up to 320 grit 
	using the new orbital sander with its hook and loop sanding discs. What a wonderful 
	upgrade from the old Craftsman sander that used 1/4 sheets. The cat parts were 
	washed with soap and water to remove any last traces of the rouge.  
</p>

<p>
	A busy Saturday morning began with preparing a patch for the bottom corner of the 
	seat that had chipped out during class. The chipout's arc was filed smooth and a 
	matching scrap of cherry was prepared to fit. This was glued in place and clamped 
	as seen below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC chip repair.heic" alt="The scrap of cherry glued into the chipped seat corner" width="1686" height="1956">

<p>
	While the glue was drying the cat inlay was completed. First the body, face, and 
	feet were put into the depression after dripping in Starbond thin super glue. The 
	accelerant was sprayed on instantly curing the glue. Glue was dripped into the tail 
	depression, the tail put in place and again accelerant was sprayed on. The photo 
	below shows the inlay at this stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC body inlay.heic" alt="The body and other major parts glued into the crest rail" width="2109" height="1861">

<p>
	Each of the small pieces was put in place after dripping in glue. When all were in 
	position the accelerant was sprayed on fixing them. As seen in the first photo below, 
	glue got onto the brass around one eye. This necessitated sanding the brass to 
	remove the glue and then further sanding up to 1000 grit. The Dremel was used to 
	polish the sanded areas of the brass and aluminum after putting tape over the 
	adjacent wood. A lot of hand sanding of the wood was done around the periphery to 
	get rid of the glue stains. The second photo below shows the finished inlay, which 
	as planned is proud of the crest rail surface.
</p>

<p>
	The excess material from the patch was removed with a rasp. Lines were drawn on both 
	corners and they were rasped until the lines were met. A file was used to fine tune 
	the rounded corners. A drawn curve in the first photo shows the plan. The next two 
	photos show both corners after rasping and filing to the lines.

<p>
	Consideration was given to rounding the sides of the seat. Looking at a photo of the 
	model convinced me not to undertake rounding before glue-up. The rounded seat needs 
	to flow into the curves on the legs, so will await assembly.
</p>

<p>
	Planning on glue-up today, so tackled a few jobs that could be done in advance. The 
	spindles were all sanded up to 320 grit. The seat was also sanded on both the front 
	and back to 320 grit. Minimal sanding was done on the outer edges as these still 
	need sculpting, but the bulk of the seat is done. Much of the seat and the spindles 
	will be covered prior to glue-up to ensure glue does not get on the sanded surfaces.
</p>

<p>
	Now it is time for dry assembly and a final inspection to determine if everything that 
	can be done to the individual parts has been done. After thinking through the best 
	order of assembly the chair was put together. The front legs went on first and 
	clamped from side to side. These are independent of all other parts so can be glued 
	and forgotten prior to further assembly. The arm supports went on next and were 
	also clamped only from side to side. 
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC leg assembly.heic" alt="The legs and arm supports go together first" width="3223" height="1792">

<p>
	The rest of the chair was assembled. This is the tricky part for gluing as so many 
	surfaces need to be glued and quickly assembled before the glue sets up. The spindles 
	were installed in the seat and the crest added to their tops. No glue is used on the 
	ends of the spindles. The back legs were inserted into the seat joints and clamped 
	from side to side at the joint. A clamp was also added to hold the biscuit joints 
	between legs and crest rail in place. With the scraps remaining from bandsawing out 
	the back legs they were clamped to the seat front to back. At this point I ran out 
	of clamps, three more are required. A pipe clamp was temporarily called into service, 
	but it is too heavy for me to feel comfortable using it. I have no clamps long 
	enough for pulling the arms flush with the back legs, though do have clamps for 
	holding them vertically.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC clamp short.heic" alt="The entire chair assembled though missing needed clamps" width="2784" height="3263">

<p>
	Yet another trip to Menards provided more clamps. Exploring Titebond's website 
	indicated that Titebond III has the longest setup time, so that is the glue chosen. 
	Adjustments were made on two joints, where the arms meet the back legs, providing 
	a better fit. Further inspection revealed no work needed before the glue-up. The front 
	legs were glued on and clamped. The remainder was then glued. Dowels were cut to fit 
	in the arms and glued in. Glue was spread on all mating surfaces and these were 
	pressed into place and clamped. What a nightmare! But it is complete at 2 in the 
	afternoon. The clamps will be left on for 24 hours as there is a lot of tension in 
	most joints.

	After a Labor Day morning of rock picking at Sugar Creek with the two older grandsons 
	the chair was unclamped. It is solid as a rock and quite heavy. The picture below 
	shows the chair, not quite a rocker yet.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC chair.heic" alt="The chair glued together and ready for sculpting sanding and rockers" width="2499" height="3473">

<p>
	Sculpting began in earnest this morning. The chair was clamped to the top of the 
	tablesaw. Lines were sketched around the periphery of the legs and seat bottom as 
	seen in the first photo below. The usual tools were used to create a clearly 
	defined chamfer around this half-loop. The front leg-seat joint was flattened. The 
	arm support-seat joint was sculpted, significantly altering its profile as I struggled 
	to get the previous profile correct with the tools at hand. The back leg-seat joint 
	was also flattened and sculpted a bit as the leg is proud of the seat. The inside of 
	the back leg leading up to the arm joint was rounded. The results of this work are 
	shown below in the second photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC leg seat.heic" alt="The sculpting done on the legs and seat on one side of the chair" width="3037" height="2899">

<p>
	The opposite side was sculpted similarly, though only I will ever carefully compare 
	the two sides.
</p>

<p>
	A dedication needs to be carved in the bottom of the seat, probably something like: 
</p>

<p class="note">
	For Freddie on his first birthday,
</p>

<p class="note">
	all our love,
</p>

<p class="note">
	Momma and Poppa Mac
</p>

<p>
	The dedication was printed out in Euphoria Script and transfered to the seat bottom 
	using carbon paper. A sample was also transfered to a scrap of cherry. An attempt 
	was made to carve the text into the cherry, but it looked pretty bad, so a Sharpie 
	was chosen to ink the text onto the cherry. The result is shown in the photo below. 
	A quick test indicates that boiled linseed oil does not cause the text to run.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC dedication.heic" alt="The dedication written on the bottom of the seat" width="1936" height="1599">

<p>
	One arm, its support and the back leg in the same vicinity was completed. First, the 
	joints were brought to level across the faces, then lines were added and the joints 
	shaped to the desired profile. The photos below show the sculpted arm. The joints 
	have gaps and will need some work during sanding to hide the gaps. The second arm 
	was finished similarly. An odd discrepancy was noted: the left arm and right arm 
	are not the same. One is convex on the front and the other on the back!
</p>

<p>
	Began with the back of the seat this morning, putting a large curve around its length. 
	The legs stuck out the back so they were chiseled to rough shape and then rasped and 
	filed to round them and blend in the chiseled areas. Sanding with the new hand sander 
	removed the chisel gouges. The final thing tackled were the parts of the legs below 
	the seat. These were rounded as needed. The photos below document this work.
</p>

	The last sculpting accomplished this morning were the tops of the back legs along with 
	the crest rail. This trio is seen in the first photo below. After lunch the rockers 
	were glued in place with 1/2" dowels supporting the four joints. The clamped rockers 
	are also seen below. It is no longer a chair, but a rocking chair!

	Happy birthday to me! Clamps were removed and the rocker was set upright. It sits so 
	far back on the rockers that it can only rock a few degrees backwards!! The picture 
	below shows how close the backs of the rockers are to stopping any backward rocking. 
	The maple back legs are just too heavy. Either the back legs will have to be 
	significantly thinned or a counterweight will need to be added below the seat front. 
	The crest rail has yet to be sculpted on the back side and could also be a source of 
	weight reduction.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC no rock.heic" alt="The rocking chair sitting on the tablesaw and showing how little backward movement is possible" width="2940" height="3268">


<p>
	Meanwhile, work began on leg sculpting where the legs meet the rockers. The front and 
	back leg on one side were finished in 1&nbsp;1/2 hours. A rest was in order. The 
	photo below shows these completed joints. The legs on the opposite side were finished 
	as well.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC leg rocker.heic" alt="The front and back legs on one side sculpted at the rocker joints" width="2888" height="2122">

<p>
	Decided to first remove material from the top of the back legs and from the crest 
	rail. The rail was marked as seen in the first photo and a few attempts with the 
	chisel to remove material. Turned to the angle grinder with a 60 grit sanding wheel. 
	Five minutes later almost 1/2" of wood had been removed and was now scattered all 
	over the shop. The second photo shows the reduced back leg.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC reduced.heic" alt="The back legreduced to the line with the angle grinder" width="2363" height="2583">

<p>
	The crest rail was reduced next. It was marked about 5/8" deep at the top tapering 
	to nothing at the bottom. The first photo shows the rough angle grinder work and the 
	second photo shows the final profile after angle grinding and a bit of hand sanding. 
	The backs of the legs were also rounded also seen in the second photo.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC rail smooth.heic" alt="The crest rail smoothed with the angle grinder and a bit of hand sanding" width="2049" height="2503">

<p>
	Sanding started with the oscillating sander and 60 grit sandpaper. The coarse grit 
	was necessary to get rid of filing and rasping marks. 90% of the surfaces were 
	accessible with the sander. The surfaces that were more well hidden were sanded by 
	hand with 60 grit and 120 grit sandpaper. Multiple joint gaps were filled. The 
	narrowest were filled with a bit of glue followed by sanding. The wider gaps were 
	filled with a mixture of glue and sawdust. After drying these filled gaps required 
	significant sanding.
</p>

<p>
	Sanding began in earnest this morning, beginning with 180 grit. Significant 
	effort was needed to remove all of the file marks that for some reason had not been 
	removed with the coarser grit paper. Lighting is key to see these marks. Again most 
	of the sanding can be done with the new oscillating sander. Many small hard to reach 
	areas required hand sanding. These were sanded with the worn hook and loop paper, 
	which is mostly worn out on the edges, there are few flat surfaces. Six hours of 
	sanding and it is ready for a finer grit.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC 180 sand 2.heic" alt="The chair back after sanding with 180 grit sandpaper" width="2508" height="4407">

<p>
	Sanding with 220 grit sandpaper was next and took about three hours, two for the 
	oscillating sander and one for the hand sanding. A further three hours completed the 
	sanding with 320 grit sandpaper. Tape was removed from the crest rail, the spindles, 
	and the seat. More sanding with 320 grit on these parts was done by hand except for 
	the seat which was amenable to the oscillating sander. After removing the dust, 
	wiping and blowing using the shopvac the rocker was ready for applying a finish. It 
	is shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC finish sand.heic" alt="The chair with all sanding to 320 grit complete" width="2947" height="3759">

<p>
	The first finish to be applied is boiled linseed oil. The oil was wiped on with a 
	shop rag. It was not flooded like some sites recommend, but just enough oil was on 
	the rag to thoroughly wet the surface. None remained on the surface to wipe off. The 
	photo shows the chair with its new coloring. Boiled linseed oil requires as long as 
	seven days to fully cure. I won't have time to work on the chair for the next five 
	days as I am taking a weeklong class.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC linseed oil.heic" alt="The chair after applying a coat of boiled linseed oil" width="3043" height="4363">

<p>
	My grandson's birthday party was yesterday. His parents saw a very early photo of the 
	chair in progress. The family will be up this coming Saturday, so I have plenty of 
	time to complete the chair.
</p>

<p>
	The chair was carried to the garage this morning after wiping off any remaining dust 
	and giving the metal a quick buff. The rocker was surrounded by plastic and sprayed 
	with Watco semi-gloss lacquer from all sides. The photo below shows the chair at this 
	stage.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/SRC first coat.heic" alt="The chair after applying a coat of spray-on lacquer" width="2696" height="3123">

<p>
	Two hours between each of three coats and then a day to completely dry. The next day 
	the chair was lightly sanded with 0000 steel wool. The steel wool is very gentle, but 
	the mess it leaves behind is quite the pain. The chair was first blown partially 
	clean and then vacuumed. A fourth coat of lacquer was sprayed on in a few places: 
	arms, top and bottom of the seat. These spots were rubbed out with the steel wool. 
	Paste wax applied liberally, allowed to dry, and buffed to a shine completing the 
	project.
</p>

<p>
	And a few photos to conclude this rather long-winded build.
