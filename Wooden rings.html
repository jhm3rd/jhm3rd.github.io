<p class=first>
	I stumbled across a 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRgLMr89v2I&amp;t=27s">YouTube video</a> 
	on making wood rings from veneer. The project looked simple and ideal for making 
	something unique for the two older grandsons. The video includes inlay, providing 
	multiple opportunities to tailor the rings for each boy.
</p>

<p>
	The veneer box was pulled down from storage above the basement freezer and three 
	veneers were selected, all dark. 1/2" strips were cut that are each 10-12" long. 
	The strips were placed in boiling water for ten minutes, wood tea. in the interim three 
	cylinders were selected as bending forms, two sockets and a piece of 3/8" brass 
	tubing. The two sockets are slightly smaller than my and my wife's finger diameters. 
	The brass tubing is slightly smaller than the older grandson's finger. His brother's 
	finger is assumed to be similar in size.
</p>

	</tbody>
</table>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG soaking veneer.heic" alt="The veneer strips soaking in hot water" width="2551" height="1981">

<p>
	The sockets and tubing were covered in a layer of packing tape. After soaking in 
	the hot water the strips were not soft enough as revealed by trying to wrap them 
	around even the largest socket, so they were returned to the water, heated in the 
	microwave and sat for an additional ten minutes. This was again repeated when a 
	second attempt at form wrapping failed.
</p>

<p>
	After the third soak two of the veneers readily went around either of the sockets. 
	None were tried around the brass tube as the smaller socket was difficult enough. 
	Soaking all of the different veneers at the same time was probably not a good idea. 
	The darkest served to stain the lighter veneers and they now all look more or less 
	the same. We will see what they look like after drying. Rubber bands were put on 
	after the tight winding.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG wet wind.heic" alt="The wet veneer strips wound around the sockets and held with a rubber band " width="1634" height="1763">

<p>
	A second experiment was also undertaken. A strip of veneer from each of the three 
	woods was soaked with veneer softener from 
	<a href="https://www.veneersupplies.com/">Veneer Supplies</a>. They were left to stand 
	in the softener for fifteen minutes. This proved slightly less effective than the 
	boiling water, though those got three shots. The most recalcitrant of the veneers, 
	the reddish brown, highly figured veneer was still impossible to wrap around the 
	largest socket without cracking.
</p>

<p>
	Two dried veneers were selected and removed from the sockets. They remained in a tight 
	curl. The internal ends were sanded to a wedge shape. The strips were rewound around 
	the small and large sockets and a lot of super glue, Star Bond, was dripped on, 
	initially on the edges and then all over the nascent ring. After drying the rings 
	were removed from the sockets and sanded inside and out, by hand and when held on the 
	lathe. The two resulting rings are shown in the second photo below. A ways to go, but 
	looking decent.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG first sanding.heic" alt="The veneer strip rings after gluing and sanding" width="1233" height="1145">

<p>
	The next step is inlay. For the smaller ring, the ring for the wife, three overlapping 
	hearts are planned, ideally from two or three different metals. The photo below shows 
	the planned inlay. The inlay design was drawn onto the smaller ring with a white 
	pencil.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG drawn.heic" alt="The inlay sketch drawn onto ring" width="1467" height="1280">

<p>
	The dremel equipped with a 1/32" end mill was used to cut out the design after 
	struggling with an Xacto knife. A scrap of brass was sanded with 120 grit sandpaper 
	producing the needed brass dust. The dust was poured into the cut out heart and a few 
	drops of super glue were dripped onto the pile. Four photos below document this 
	process.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG dust glued.heic" alt="The brass dust glued with super glue" width="1573" height="1641">

<p>
	After the glue had dried the two hearts on the sides were treated similarly, with 
	Dremel routing followed by freshly ground aluminum powder and glue. The photo below 
	shows the ring at this stage, not too impressive. After drying the ring was pushed 
	onto the socket and sanded in the lathe up to 400 grit. After removing dust the ring 
	was coated in super glue. This is shown below. I am not impressed with this inlay 
	technique and will try solid pieces next.
</p>

<p>
	The larger ring was decorated next with a line of copper around its center. The ring 
	was placed back on the socket and held in the lathe. A 0.065" groove was cut on 
	center around the ring with the parting tool. This groove was cut 0.040" deep. Copper 
	wire, 1/16" diameter, was bent around the ring. The two joining ends were located 
	and both were cut at an angle. The wire was pressed into the groove. Of course it 
	wants to spring back out, so it was glued in by segments. The photo below shows the 
	ring just before gluing the last segment.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG wire gluing.heic" alt="Ring after gluing most of the wire inlay in place" width="1624" height="1862">

<p>
	The end was glued into place and clamped, with a pair of pliers, and left to dry.
	(Definitely need to buy some accelerant!) The wire was filed down to the level of 
	the wood and sanded up to 320 grit. The ring at this stage is seen below. The ring 
	was then coated with super glue and the accelerant, just purchased along with veneer 
	samples, sprayed on. This left "bubbles" that had to be sanded away up to 400 grit. 
	The ring was then polished on the buffer. The second photo shows the finished product. 
	The ring is a good fit on my finger, but is tight going over my fat knuckle.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG wire buffed.heic" alt="Ring  with wire inlay after coating with glue and buffing" width="1457" height="1630">

<p>
	A third ring was started again with a small roll of the dark veneer. This veneer was 
	tightly wrapped around the small socket and glue was dripped on, followed by 
	accelerant to quickly dry the glue. A few rough spots as well as the outer joint were 
	sanded off.
</p>

<p class="note">
	The accelerant is essentially water. It is dissolved in a polar organic solvent, but 
	water initiates the chemical reaction causing the glue to polymerize. Expensive 
	water! The water in skin is sufficient to cause near instantaneous polymerization as 
	well.
</p>

<p>
	A small heart was cut from 1/16" thick brass sheet. This heart was glued to the 
	ring approximately on center. A line was scribed around the heart. After popping the 
	heart off of the ring the Dremel equipped with the 1/32" end mill was used to remove 
	most of the material a little less than 1/16" deep. The heart was tried and the 
	interfering areas were removed with the end mill and with the Xacto knife. After 
	multiple small corrections the heart fit well in its new pocket.
</p>

<p>
	A bit of sawdust from sanding the same veneer was pressed into the tiny gaps 
	around the edges of the heart. A drop of glue followed by accelerant completed the 
	installation of the heart inlay. These steps are documented in the photos below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG heart dusted.heic" alt="Sawdust pressed into the gaps around the inlaid heart" width="1136" height="1353">

<p>
	The ring is much too wide, so it was narrowed by sanding on the belt sander. Both 
	sides were sanded in order to keep the heart somewhat centered. The next step, done 
	on the lathe, was heavily rounding the outside corners with a file. This was followed 
	by a lot of sanding, first with 120 grit and ending with 400 grit, both inside and 
	outside. Finally, the outside of the ring was polished on the buffing wheel and the 
	inside with the Dremel buffer, both using blue rouge. The sanding and the final 
	ring with inlaid heart are seen in the two photos below.

<p>
	Rings for the grandsons began with some brass scrap. A 1/2" round bar had been drilled 
	and tapped at some point in the past. A 1.5" length of this brass was bored to 0.40". 
	Two 1/2" lengths were parted off and the ends deburred. These two tubes will serve 
	both as forms for the veneer winding and also as the central cores of the rings.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG brass cores.heic" alt="The brass tubes to serve as cores in two small rings" width="1571" height="1411">

<p>
	Two of the lighter colored veneer strips that had previously been soaked and wrapped 
	around the larger socket were repurposed. These two coils of veneer were returned to 
	boiling water for ten minutes. Both were rolled successfully around the 1/2" diameter 
	brass tubes, though one was tighter than the other. The photo below shows the rolled, 
	rubber-banded, and drying veneer strips.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG small rolls.heic" alt="The veneer strips after soaking and rolling around the brass cores" width="1703" height="1149">

<p>
	The dried veneer curls were tightly wrapped around the brass inserts and glued in 
	place in spots along the edges. The rings were then covered with super glue and 
	quickly dried with the accelerant. The sides of the rings were sanded on the belt 
	sander to get down to the brass inserts. The first photo below shows the dried veneer
	curls and the second the glued rings before sanding.

<p>
	It is time for decoration and i struggled a bit trying to think of something I could 
	do and at the same time would look good. The boys' birth constellation was considered 
	but abandoned when looking at the shapes needed and struggling with how to fit them 
	on a ring. The next idea was more fruitful, the planets visible in the Oklahoma night 
	sky on the date of their birth. A 
	<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/usa/tulsa">website</a> was 
	quickly located that provided this info. The planets visible on Levi's birth day were 
	Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Ollie's were Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and 
	Saturn, surprisingly similar.
</p>

<p>
	The plan is to make the planets from wire or rod. Mercury will be 1/32" aluminum, 
	Venus 1/16" aluminum, Mars 1/16" brass, Jupiter 1/8" aluminum (or steel), and Saturn 
	1/8" aluminum in a 3/16" OD brass tube. Hopefully, the execution will be as simple 
	as drilling and gluing.
</p>

<p>
	Saturn was started with a 3/16" length of round brass bar stock. It was drilled and 
	reamed to 0.125". Two 1/8" lengths were parted off and reamed by hand to get rid of 
	burrs. A 1/8" diameter drill rod had two 1/8" long pieces sawed off. After deburring 
	these were pressed into the brass rings. Two Saturns are shown below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG Saturns.heic" alt="Two Saturns made from steel rod and a brass ring" width="1423" height="1279">

<p>
	Two Venuses were made by reducing an aluminum rod to 1/16" and parting off 1/8" 
	lengths. Two copies of Mars were made by parting off 1/8" lengths of 1/16" brass rod. 
	Two Jupiters were made by sawing off two more 1/8" lengths of the 1/8" drill rod. One 
	Mercury was made using a trick from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@joepie221">Joe Pie</a>. 
	The 1/4" aluminum rod was reduced to 0.09" for a little over 1/8". This was further 
	reduced in one pass of 0.03" leaving the 1/32" rod. This was easily removed. This 
	reduced rod is seen before removal in the first photo below. The second photo shows 
	all of the planets made.

<p>
	Considered putting in Earth using a blue "jewel", but was unable to find the plastic 
	jewels I used in the distant past for some no longer remembered project. In any event 
	it is time to drill the rings for planet installation. The rings were held in the 
	vise on the mill and drilled about 1/8" deep after marking out the locations of the 
	desired holes with a white lead pencil. The first photo below shows the drilling and 
	the second the drilled holes in one ring.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG drilled.heic" alt="The rings drilled for the planets" width="1158" height="1262">

<p>
	The planets were first installed without glue to check fit. The smallest drill I own 
	is 0.040", so the Mercury wire is a bit loose. Jupiter and Venus were tight so their 
	holes were opened up by hand with a drill 2 or 3 thou larger. All of the planet wires 
	were glued into their respective holes. The dry fits and the glued planets are seen 
	in the three photos below.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG glued planets.heic" alt="The planets glued into the holes drilled into the rings" width="1413" height="1407">

<p>
	In order to file off the excess planet wire a mandrel was quickly made from a 1/2" 
	brass round scrap by cutting it at a 3&deg; angle. The ring was tapped on and 
	held in the chuck on the lathe. With the chuck locked in place with two wedges 
	underneath, the excess metal was filed off. The first photo below shows the filing 
	setup. The second shows the rings after filing off most of the excess.
</p>

<img class=inline src="images/WRG filed planets.heic" alt="The rings after filing off the excess planet wire" width="1578" height="1574">

<p>
	The rings are much too wide for the grandson's fingers, so were thinned down on the 
	belt sander. They are both 0.34" wide after sanding, maybe still too wide, but this 
	can be addressed later, if needed. A coat of super glue was applied to all surfaces 
	prior to the first round of sanding.
</p>

<p>
	The rings were sanded and corners rounded. The sanding used 120 to 600 grit sand paper 
	and included the inside of the brass inserts. The rings were then polished on a 
	buffing wheel without any rouge. The insides of the inserts were polished with the 
	Dremel after reducing the diameter of the little buffing wheel with an Xacto blade.
	The two completed rings are shown below and conclude ring making for now.
